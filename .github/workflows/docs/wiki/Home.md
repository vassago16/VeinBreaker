# **VEINBREAKER**  
































### *A Stylish Action TTRPG of Blood, Resolve & Broken Chains*

You weren’t a hero.

You were a normal person — *until the dungeon took you.*

Dragged from modern reality into a violent world of shifting stone and living shadow, you awaken with only questions… and a voice in the walls whispering the answers. The Dungeon **knows you**, **speaks to you**, and promises strength — if you can survive long enough to take it.

**Play fast. Chain attacks. Spend Resolve like gasoline.**  
Every fight is a puzzle of momentum, risk, and brutal execution. You aren't just rolling dice — you're **piloting a character who learns the rules of this world and uses them against it.**

Meta-knowledge isn’t cheating here.  
It’s expected.  
The Dungeon watches, and it **rewards style.**

## 🩸 THE HOOK

Veinbreaker isn’t about waiting for your turn.  
It's about **knowing when to press**, when to **overcharge**, when to **gamble your blood for power**, and when to **go for the kill.**

Every ability is a tool.  
Every chain is a risk.  
Every execution is a reward.

You’ll **bleed enemies to prime finishers**, **ignite blood like gunpowder**, **shatter armor to open windows**, or **ascend into crimson godhood** if fate lets you.

Fail, and the Dungeon carves you into the walls.

## 🎮 WHAT IT *FEELS* LIKE

If *Bloodborne* and *Devil May Cry* had a tabletop child —  
where the DM is the final boss,  
and the players win through **skill, aggression, and audacity**,  
not grinding.

Combat turns are **seconds, not minutes.**  
You **chain techniques like a combo game**, not a slow tactical sim.

You don't wait for the game to give permission.  
You take it.
