# 📙 THE VEINBREAKER CODEX: FOR GAME MASTERS ONLY

*A forbidden guide for those who command the Dungeon.*

---

## Book I — The Dungeon Speaks [Running Veinbreaker]

The Dungeon is not a backdrop. It is an *opponent*.

This Codex is for you — the one who speaks as its walls, teeth, and whispers.

Use this alongside the **Player Guide** and **Chain Combat Manual**. Players see rules and blood. You see *pressure*, *pattern*, and *consequence*.

---

## Book II — Wrath of Chainbreakers [Enemy Design & AI Behavior]

### Enemy AI Types (Overview)

- **Aggressor:** pushes interrupts early, punishes misses.
- **Defender:** raises guard, forces players to reposition.
- **Stalker:** counters after movement, bleeds targets.
- **Juggernaut:** ignores flurries, weak to heavy finishers.
- **Aberrant:** mutates as Blood Marks accumulate.

---

### 🧠 ENEMY AI ARCHETYPES (Full Writeups)

> Enemies in Veinbreaker are not stat blocks — they are **behaviors**. Their goal is to **punish patterns**, reward bravery, and tempt greed.

#### 👹 Aggressor — *"Burst them before they burst you."*

- Opens combat fast — charges, leaps, ambush starts.
- Interrupts early (**chain ≥3 or after first miss**).
- Takes risks — leaves openings after heavy swings.
- Weakness: **Movement effects + counters** reset momentum.
- Player Reward: Punish by dodging, then heavy finisher.

#### 🛡 Defender — *"Walls respond to force."*

- Turtles — waits for overcommit.
- Interrupt on **repeated same action**.
- Armor reduces hit damage, stagger on heavy.
- Weakness: **Guard Break + bleed stacks**.
- Reward: Slow kill that feels earned.

#### 🕷 Stalker — *"Bleed the legs, not the heart."*

- Loves when players move.
- Triggers Interrupt on **Movement reset**.
- Applies **Bleed/Poison** — slow death.
- Weakness: **Flurry spam** breaks focus.

#### 💀 Juggernaut — *"Hits like a truck, dies like a shrine."*

- Slow, massive swings — ignores small hits.
- Flurry deals **half damage**.
- Interrupt only on **chain 6+ or critical miss**.
- Weakness: **Heavy > Ability > Execute** flow.

#### 🩸 Aberrant — *"The dungeon reshapes what it loves."*

- Corrupted — mutates mid-fight.
- Gains new Ability every **Blood Mark gained**.
- Weakness: None consistent — players must adapt.

> Use different archetypes to change *how* combat feels without changing any core math.

### ⚙ ENCOUNTER BUILDING & SCALING

> **1 Room = 1 Story.** Every encounter should ask a question.

Formula:

```text
Threat Total = Sum of Enemy Tiers + Modifiers
```

Modifiers:\
+1 if Arena Hazard\
+1 if Elite Trait\
+2 if Aberrant mutation present\
+2 per Reinforcement Wave

Difficulty Targets:

- **Easy:** Threat 1–2
- **Standard:** Threat 3–4
- **Deadly:** Threat 5–7
- **Despair:** Threat 8+ (*Hunter may intervene*)

---

### 🧪 Behavior Logic (Flow as Rules)

Use these as **soft triggers**, not hard laws:

- If Player repeats same action twice → **Defender** Interrupt chance +20%
- If Player misses after Heavy → **Aggressor** counterstrike chance +30%
- If Player Moves at penalty -1 or better → **Stalker** applies Bleed/Poison
- If Player chains past 6 → **Juggernaut** gains +Interrupt and damage boost
- If Blood Mark ≥3 → **Aberrant** mutates its ability pool

> The dungeon **evolves with the player**. Let it remember patterns.

---

## Book IV — Blood Marks & Corruption [Power, Mutation & Risk]

> **Blood Marks are temptation made visible.** A reward for brutality — a countdown to becoming prey.

Every time a player performs an **Execute**, they gain **1 Blood Mark**. Each mark empowers them **and** feeds the Dungeon.

### 🩸 Blood Mark Rules (Core)

| Blood Marks | Player Gain | Dungeon Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 Mark** | +1 Passive Damage vs wounded foes | Whispers begin — tension rises |
| **2 Marks** | +1 Resolve on Crit | Elite enemies react aggressively |
| **3 Marks** | +1 Technique Slot OR Temporary Buff | **Hunter becomes aware** (clock starts) |
| **4 Marks** | +10% Execute Threshold | Aberrant mutation triggers in next encounter |
| **5+ Marks** | Choose: Ascend or Fall | Hunter stalks — safe rooms no longer safe |

**Marks are power — but every mark is a door.**

---

## ☠️  — DEATH & THE DUN

Death is not a reset.  
It is a **scar**.

When a player character dies:

- They **respawn at the last Safe Room**
- All current combat and effects end
- All **unspent Veinscore is lost**
- Blood Marks are retained

They gain a **Dun**.

---

### The Dun (Death Unmark)

A **Dun** is a *faded, inert Blood Mark*.

- Grants **no bonuses**
- Cannot be spent, cleansed, or converted
- Persists permanently
- **Adds +1 to Total Blood Marks**

> The Dungeon does not care *how* you were marked.  
> Only that you were.

---


### 🔻 Losing & Cleansing Blood Marks

Blood Marks are meant to **stack**, not vanish. The Dungeon wants you deeper.

Can be removed only by:

- **Relic Shrine** (rare)
- **Veinscore Offering** (cost increases each time)
- **Special NPC / Contract** (may have consequences)
- **Boss Soul Consumption** (*converts mark → permanent stat*)

> Cleansing should feel costly, like tearing power from your own veins.

---

### 🧬 Corruption Track — How the Player Changes

Blood Marks also track **psychological bleed**. As Marks rise, the **Dungeon speaks clearer**.

Narrative effects you may apply:

- Hallucinations during chain misses
- Voices offering buffs for violence
- Choices that reward cruelty over caution
- Parley becomes harder, intimidation stronger

At **5+ Marks**, character risks **Becoming the Hunter** in NG+.

---

### 🩸 The Tremor Clock — When the Dungeon Hunts

When Blood Marks ≥ 3, start a **hidden pursuit meter**. Each of the following ticks the clock forward:

- Safe Room use (unless sanctified)
- Long chain battles
- Loud executions
- Arena phase transitions
- Looting relics of the Dungeon

When the meter fills → **Hunter event triggers**.

**The table should feel the room grow cold.**

---

### 💀 Hunter Event (Preview — Full in Book V)

- Lights dim
- Footsteps echo
- Combat timer accelerates
- Running becomes a chain action

Players must **escape, hide, or repel** — killing the Hunter is *impossible*.

**Hunter Arrival = The run has changed tone.**

---

# 📕 Book V — The Hunter Walks  
## *[Pursuit & Terror]*

> *“You taught the Dungeon how to kill like you.  
> Now it wants to see if you can outrun yourself.”*

The Hunter is not a monster.  
It is **the Dungeon’s attention made mobile**.

When Blood Marks rise, when Veinscore is hoarded, when executions become routine, the Dungeon stops watching passively.

It **hunts**.

This Book defines how pursuit works, how terror escalates, and how a run permanently changes once the Hunter begins to walk.

---

## 🩸 V.1 — WHEN THE HUNTER IS BORN

The Hunter is **not random**. It is *earned*.

The Hunter becomes active when **any** of the following occur:

- A player reaches **Blood Mark 3**
- The **Tremor Clock** fills
- A Dungeon Favor explicitly “turns its gaze”
- A Veinscore Hoard event is triggered (GM discretion)

> **Hunter Activation is irreversible for the run.**  
> Once the Hunter Walks, the Dungeon no longer pretends you are guests.

---

## ⏱ V.2 — THE PURSUIT CLOCK (VISIBLE PRESSURE)

Once active, place a **Pursuit Clock** on the table.

This clock represents *how close the Hunter is*, not where it is.

### Clock Size (Choose One)

- **Short Hunt (4 segments)** — brutal, fast one-shots
- **Standard Hunt (6 segments)** — default campaign mode
- **Relentless Hunt (8 segments)** — long runs, high mastery tables

---

### ⏫ What Advances the Pursuit Clock

Tick the clock **once** when any of the following happen:

- A player performs an **Execution**
- A chain reaches **6+ actions**
- A safe room is used
- A Vein Sigil is looted or consumed
- A Blood Mark is gained
- The party lingers after combat
- A boss phase transition completes

Tick it **twice** if:
- The action was loud, flashy, or cruel
- The party mocks or taunts the Dungeon
- The Dungeon was recently impressed

> The Hunter advances faster when entertained.

---

## 👁 V.3 — TERROR STATES (ESCALATION PHASES)

As the Pursuit Clock fills, the Dungeon’s behavior changes.

### 🟡 **State I — Unease** *(0–1 ticks)*

- Sounds carry farther
- Footsteps echo where no one stands
- Minor UI distortions appear

**Mechanical Pressure**
- +1 Interrupt chance for enemies
- GM begins foreshadowing the Hunter

---

### 🟠 **State II — Stalked** *(2–3 ticks)*

- Distant breathing
- Shadows lag behind movement
- Doors hesitate before opening

**Mechanical Pressure**
- Enemies gain **+1 Interrupt**
- First failed Reaction per encounter causes **Distracted**
- Movement actions feel “watched”

---

### 🔴 **State III — Closing** *(4–5 ticks)*

- Lights dim
- Walls pulse
- The Dungeon speaks in full sentences

**Mechanical Pressure**
- Interrupts occur **earlier in chains**
- Safe rooms are no longer safe
- Running becomes a **chain action**
- One random enemy per encounter gains a **Hunter Trait**

---

### ⚫ **State IV — The Hunter Walks** *(Clock Full)*

The Hunter manifests.

Not fully.  
Not cleanly.  
Enough.

---

## 💀 V.4 — THE HUNTER (ENTITY RULES)

The Hunter **cannot be killed**.

Do not give it HP.  
Do not give it loot.  
Do not let players “solve” it.

### The Hunter Has:

- **Infinite Interrupts**
- **Perfect Pathing** (no terrain penalties)
- **Adaptive Defense** (repeats are punished)
- **No fixed position** — it is always “near enough”

---

### 🩸 Hunter Actions (GM Menu)

Each round the Hunter is present, choose **ONE**:

- **Break the Chain** — Immediately end a declared chain
- **Steal Momentum** — Set all player Momentum to 0
- **Mark the Bold** — Give +1 Blood Mark to the most aggressive player
- **Seal the Exit** — Lock movement options for one round
- **Mock the Weak** — Impose Disadvantage on Resolve Actions

> The Hunter does not roll dice.  
> It enforces consequences.

---

## 🏃 V.5 — ESCAPE, HIDE, OR REPULSE

When the Hunter appears, players must choose **one strategy**:

### **Run**
- Requires chained Movement actions
- Balance penalties stack faster
- One stumble may end the escape

### **Hide**
- Requires environment use, silence, sacrifice
- Costs time → advances the clock
- Success resets the clock **by 2**

### **Repulse**
- Spend Resolve, Relics, or Blood Marks
- Push the Hunter back temporarily
- Costs something **permanent**

> Victory against the Hunter is measured in **survival**, not dominance.

---

## 🕯 V.6 — AFTERMATH: A CHANGED RUN

Once the Hunter has appeared at least once:

- Blood Mark gain accelerates
- Veinscore drops improve — but are dangerous
- NPCs react with fear or reverence
- The Dungeon’s tone hardens

At **two Hunter appearances**:
- Aberrant enemies become common
- Bosses gain new phases
- Safe mechanics erode

At **three appearances**:
- The Dungeon begins grooming a successor

---

## 👑 V.7 — BECOMING THE HUNTER (END STATE)

At **Blood Mark 5+**, the Dungeon may offer a choice:

- **Ascend** — Gain permanent power, lose humanity
- **Fall** — Become prey forever
- **Refuse** — The Hunter never stops

This is not balance.  
This is *judgment*.

> *“You wanted to be seen.  
> Now decide what you are worth.”*

---

## 📌 GM PRINCIPLES (READ THIS)

- The Hunter should feel **inevitable**, not random
- Do not overuse it — **anticipation is terror**
- Never fully explain it
- Let silence do work
- If players feel safe, you are doing it wrong
