📙 THE VEINBREAKER CODEX: FOR GAME MASTERS ONLY

A forbidden guide for those who command the Dungeon.

Book I — The Dungeon Speaks [Running Veinbreaker]

The Dungeon is not a backdrop. It is an opponent.

This Codex is for you — the one who speaks as its walls, teeth, and whispers.

Use this alongside the Player Guide and Chain Combat Manual. Players see rules and blood. You see pressure, pattern, and consequence.

Book II — Wrath of Chainbreakers [Enemy Design & AI Behavior]

Enemy AI Types (Overview)

- Aggressor: pushes interrupts early, punishes misses.
- Defender: raises guard, forces players to reposition.
- Stalker: counters after movement, bleeds targets.
- Juggernaut: ignores flurries, weak to heavy finishers.
- Aberrant: mutates as Blood Marks accumulate.

🧠 ENEMY AI ARCHETYPES (Full Writeups)

Enemies in Veinbreaker are not stat blocks — they are behaviors. Their goal is to punish patterns, reward bravery, and tempt greed.

👹 Aggressor — "Burst them before they burst you."

- Opens combat fast — charges, leaps, ambush starts.
- Interrupts early (chain ≥3 or after first miss).
- Takes risks — leaves openings after heavy swings.
- Weakness: Movement effects + counters reset momentum.
- Player Reward: Punish by dodging, then heavy finisher.

🛡 Defender — "Walls respond to force."

- Turtles — waits for overcommit.
- Interrupt on repeated same action.
- Armor reduces hit damage, stagger on heavy.
- Weakness: Guard Break + bleed stacks.
- Reward: Slow kill that feels earned.

🕷 Stalker — "Bleed the legs, not the heart."

- Loves when players move.
- Triggers Interrupt on Movement reset.
- Applies Bleed/Poison — slow death.
- Weakness: Flurry spam breaks focus.

💀 Juggernaut — "Hits like a truck, dies like a shrine."

- Slow, massive swings — ignores small hits.
- Flurry deals half damage.
- Interrupt only on chain 6+ or critical miss.
- Weakness: Heavy > Ability > Execute flow.

🩸 Aberrant — "The dungeon reshapes what it loves."

- Corrupted — mutates mid-fight.
- Gains new Ability every Blood Mark gained.
- Weakness: None consistent — players must adapt.

Use different archetypes to change how combat feels without changing any core math.

Book III — Monsters Forged in Meat [Templates & Encounter Building]

📊 ENEMY TIER STAT TEMPLATES (Veinbreaker Native)

Build a monster in 30 seconds.

TIER 1 — Fodder / Initiate

Threat: ★★ | Chain Pressure: Med | Reward: Mid VS
HP 14–24 | Defense 12–14 | Interrupt +2 | Damage 1d6–1d8

⚙ ENCOUNTER BUILDING & SCALING

1 Room = 1 Story. Every encounter should ask a question.

Formula:

text
Threat Total = Sum of Enemy Tiers + Modifiers

Modifiers:
+1 if Arena Hazard
+1 if Elite Trait
+2 if Aberrant mutation present
+2 per Reinforcement Wave

Difficulty Targets:

- Easy: Threat 1–2
- Standard: Threat 3–4
- Deadly: Threat 5–7
- Despair: Threat 8+ (Hunter may intervene)

🧪 Behavior Logic (Flow as Rules)

Use these as soft triggers, not hard laws:

- If Player repeats same action twice → Defender Interrupt chance +20%
- If Player misses after Heavy → Aggressor counterstrike chance +30%
- If Player Moves at penalty -1 or better → Stalker applies Bleed/Poison
- If Player chains past 6 → Juggernaut gains +Interrupt and damage boost
- If Blood Mark ≥3 → Aberrant mutates its ability pool

The dungeon evolves with the player. Let it remember patterns.

Book IV — Blood Marks & Corruption [Power, Mutation & Risk]

Blood Marks are temptation made visible. A reward for brutality — a countdown to becoming prey.

Every time a player performs an Execute, they gain 1 Blood Mark. Each mark empowers them and feeds the Dungeon.

🩸 Blood Mark Rules (Core)

Blood Marks Player Gain Dungeon Response
1 Mark +1 Passive Damage vs wounded foes Whispers begin — tension rises
2 Marks +1 Resolve on Crit Elite enemies react aggressively
3 Marks +1 Technique Slot OR Temporary Buff Hunter becomes aware (clock starts)
4 Marks +10% Execute Threshold Aberrant mutation triggers in next encounter
5+ Marks Choose: Ascend or Fall Hunter stalks — safe rooms no longer safe
Marks are power — but every mark is a door.

🔻 Losing & Cleansing Blood Marks

Blood Marks are meant to stack, not vanish. The Dungeon wants you deeper.

Can be removed only by:

- Relic Shrine (rare)
- Veinscore Offering (cost increases each time)
- Special NPC / Contract (may have consequences)
- Boss Soul Consumption (converts mark → permanent stat)

Cleansing should feel costly, like tearing power from your own veins.

🧬 Corruption Track — How the Player Changes

Blood Marks also track psychological bleed. As Marks rise, the Dungeon speaks clearer.

Narrative effects you may apply:

- Hallucinations during chain misses
- Voices offering buffs for violence
- Choices that reward cruelty over caution
- Parley becomes harder, intimidation stronger

At 5+ Marks, character risks Becoming the Hunter in NG+.

🩸 The Tremor Clock — When the Dungeon Hunts

When Blood Marks ≥ 3, start a hidden pursuit meter. Each of the following ticks the clock forward:

- Safe Room use (unless sanctified)
- Long chain battles
- Loud executions
- Arena phase transitions
- Looting relics of the Dungeon

When the meter fills → Hunter event triggers.

The table should feel the room grow cold.

💀 Hunter Event (Preview — Full in Book V)

- Lights dim
- Footsteps echo
- Combat timer accelerates
- Running becomes a chain action

Players must escape, hide, or repel — killing the Hunter is impossible.

Hunter Arrival = The run has changed tone.

Book V — The Hunter Walks [Pursuit & Terror]

(To be fully expanded — will define the Dungeon Hunter, its clock, and how it changes a run.)

Book VI — Hall of Bosses [Bosscraft]

(To be fully expanded — phase design, arenas, execution thresholds.)
