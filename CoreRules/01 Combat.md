# Combat & Turns (Core)

Think of a turn as who’s driving the beat, not who’s the only one acting. The turn order just structures an ongoing clash.

## Rounds and Scenes
- **Round:** One cycle in which every actor takes a turn.
- **Turn:** Your moment to drive the beat (declare a chain) or to defend/interrupt when it’s not your turn.
- **Scene:** A series of rounds that make up one continuous encounter.

## Turn Composition
- A turn has both attack and defense moments: the acting side rolls AV on its actions; the reacting side rolls DV on interrupts/defenses. These can interleave as chains and interrupts resolve.
- The start of your turn is the start of your next round: reset Balance/Momentum/Heat per rules, refresh RP, apply start-of-turn stance effects.

## What Is A3 Combat?
- Single contested roll per action: **AV = d20 + bonuses ± Balance** vs **DV = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational**.
- If AV ≥ DV, the action hits; if DV ≥ AV, it’s stopped. Margin ≥5 can trigger Perfect Defense/Block effects for the defender.
- Attacker and defender both roll; the side with momentum declares the chain (rolling AV), the other reacts with DV/interrupts until momentum flips.

## Core Systems (Quick Clarity)
- **Balance (accuracy):** Positive adds to AV; negative subtracts. Resets to 0 at your turn start unless a debuff says otherwise. Gained from Perfect Defense or specific boosts; lost from heavy/extra actions.
- **Heat (damage ramp):** Builds on hits; thresholds add damage (+0/+1/+2/+3/+4 at Heat 1–5). Between actions: Burst (spend all for bonus damage), Purge (spend all, reset Balance to 0), Stabilize (at Heat 3+, carry 2 Heat into next turn). Heat drops when your chain ends unless stabilized.
- **Momentum (defense posture):** Earned on successful Dodge/Parry/Block; fuels Perfect Defense (+1 positive Balance on Perfect). Resets to 0 at your turn start.
- **Resolve (RP):** Pay 1 RP per action in your chain, upfront. Gain RP on hits, Perfect Defense, Execution, or rare Dungeon favors. Defaults to 5 at turn start unless modified.
- **Chain Declaration:** Before rolling, state all actions/targets this turn; spend RP now. No mid-chain changes unless an effect allows it.

## Actions, Pools, and Costs
Resolve is your action currency: every action in your chain costs 1 RP, paid upfront. Abilities have a pool cost from their path (magic, faith, martial, or shadow) and cooldowns. If an ability is off cooldown and you can pay both RP and the correct pool, you can play it.

## When You Act Each Round
- **When you have momentum (attacking):** Declare and pay RP for your full chain. The defender can Interrupt/defend; if they land damage on you, your chain ends immediately.
- **When the opponent has momentum (defending):** They drive the chain. You may spend RP to Interrupt (Parry/Block/Dodge). If your defense succeeds and you can afford it, you may follow with a second action (riposte/counter). Taking damage here doesn’t “break your chain” because you’re not running one; you’re just trying to stop theirs.

## How the A3 Contest Plays Out
- **Offense role:** The acting side rolls AV vs the defender’s DV. If AV ≥ DV, the hit lands; margin ≥5 may trigger extra effects. If the defender lands damage via an interrupt, the attacker’s chain ends.
- **Defense role:** The defending side rolls DV vs the attacker’s AV when interrupting/defending. If DV ≥ AV, the hit is stopped; on a Perfect the defender may counter/riposte. Damage dealt back can end the attacker’s chain.
- **Momentum flips roles:** The side with momentum declares the chain and rolls AV; the other side reacts with DV and interrupts until momentum changes.

- The actor with the highest momentum at the end of the round (after both parties had a turn) will start as the aggressor in the next round.
