# Veinbreaker Quickstart (V1)

Fast reference for stats, actions, rhythm, and finishers.

## 1) Core Stats
- Attributes start at 8; spend 18 Veinscore (cap 14).
- HP = 10 + POWER.
- Pools (refresh each round): Martial = POW / 2; Shadow = AGI / 2; Magic = MND / 2; Faith = SPR / 2.
- Resolve (RP): refresh 2 per turn up to your cap (Tier 0: 5).
- Balance / Heat / Momentum start at 0 each turn unless modified.

## 2) Weapons & Tags
Tags unlock actions; they don’t change damage dice.

| Tag            | Grants/Enables                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Finesse        | Parry, Riposte, agile reactions      |
| Heavy          | Block, Guard Break, heavy attacks    |
| Shield         | Perfect Block, Stability actions     |
| Magic Conduit  | Redirect/Deflect (vs spells)         |
| Faith Conduit  | Ward, Radiance interactions          |
| Slashing       | Can apply Bleed (where listed)       |
| Blunt          | Can apply Stagger/Stun (where listed)|
| Piercing       | Precision/Pierce effects             |

## 3) Combat Structure (Your Turn)
- Start of turn: RP +3 (to max), Balance 0, Heat 0 (unless stabilized), Momentum 0.
- Declare your chain: list all actions and targets; each action costs 1 RP, paid upfront. No changes mid-chain unless an effect allows it.

## 4) A3 Contest (Rolls)
- AV = d20 + bonuses ± Balance
- DV = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational
- If AV ≥ DV, hit; if DV ≥ AV, stop. Margin ≥5 may trigger Perfect Defense/Block effects.

## 5) Rhythm (Balance, Heat, Momentum)
- **Balance:** Adds/subtracts from AV. Resets to 0 at turn start. Typical costs: light attack –1, heavy –2. Perfect Defense grants +1 positive.
- **Heat:** Gain 1 on hit. Thresholds: Heat 2/3/4/5 = +1/+2/+3/+4 dmg. Between actions: Burst (all Heat → bonus dmg = Heat×2), Purge (all Heat → Balance 0), Stabilize (at Heat 3+ → keep 2 Heat next turn).
- **Momentum:** Gain on successful Dodge/Parry/Block/Redirect/Ward. Improves DV and enables Perfect Defense. Resets at turn start.

## 6) Reactions (Cost 1 RP)
| Reaction  | Requires        | Effect                     | Perfect Bonus              |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Dodge     | None             | Avoid damage              | +Balance, +Momentum        |
| Parry     | Finesse/Faith    | Reduce/negate             | Riposte window, +1 RP      |
| Block     | Heavy/Shield     | Reduce/negate             | Retaliate option           |
| Redirect  | Magic Conduit    | Reduce spell/redirect     | Reflect damage             |
| Ward      | Faith Conduit    | Reduce radiant/curse      | Gain Radiance              |

## 7) Resolve Actions (Universal)
| Name            | Cost | Window   | Effect                  |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Disengage       | 3    | Defense  | End chain now           |
| Balance Surge   | 2    | Any      | Balance to 0            |
| Rhythm Break    | 2    | Defense  | Cancel next Interrupt   |
| Momentum Anchor | 1    | Any      | +1 Momentum             |
| Shift Footing   | 1    | Attack   | Move 1 zone             |
| Greed Burst     | 2    | Attack   | +2 to next AV           |

## 8) Common Status
- Bleed: 1 dmg/stack per round.
- Stagger: –1 next Attack & Defense.
- Vulnerable: +2 dmg next hit; at 3 stacks, target is Primed.
- Off-Balance: Start next turn at –2 Balance.
- Radiance: Boosts Faith; consumed by miracles.
- Quickened: Movement ignores Balance penalties.

## 9) Execution
- Only if target is Primed (e.g., Vulnerable 3, Stagger 2+, ≤25% HP, or an effect).
- Costs 1 RP; replaces next action; heavy Balance penalty (typically –2); Heat resets.
- On success: finish the target (or deal fatal damage), gain +1 Blood Mark, +1 RP. On failure: chain ends, suffer Stagger/penalty.

## 10) Blood Marks (Dungeon Attention)
| Marks | Benefit                     | Cost/Risk                |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | +1 dmg vs wounded           | Whispering               |
| 2     | +1 Momentum on Perfect      | Aggressive foes          |
