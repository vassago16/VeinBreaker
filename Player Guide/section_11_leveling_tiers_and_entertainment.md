# 🩸 **SECTION 11 — LEVELING, TIERS & ENTERTAINMENT (Veinscore Progression)**

Progression in Veinbreaker is not guaranteed. The Dungeon rewards **style**, **risk**, and **entertainment**—not mere survival.

Leveling is fueled by **Veinscore (⟟)**, earned through exploration, victories, executions, Dungeon favor, achievements, and narrative milestones.

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
“Grow. Break. Impress me.”
```

# ⭐ **11.1 VEINSCORE — THE CURRENCY OF ASCENT**

Veinscore is spent to increase Attributes and unlock higher Tiers.

- You gain Veinscore for defeating enemies.
- More Veinscore for stylish chains, close calls, executions.
- Massive Veinscore for impressing the Dungeon.

### **When you spend Veinscore, you level up.**

Level is equal to how much you have spent total, not how much you currently hold.

Unspent Veinscore is dangerous—if you die, it is lost.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Spend it before I take it back.”
```

# ⭐ **11.3 TIER SYSTEM — EARNING STYLE, NOT GRIND**

Tier unlocks are **not automatic**. They require:

- Spending the Veinscore threshold **and**
- Completing a **Tier Challenge** given by the Dungeon.

Tier Challenges test Rhythm mastery:

- **Tier 1:** Show you understand Balance.
- **Tier 2:** Show you can wield Heat.
- **Tier 3:** Show you control Momentum.
- **Tier 4:** Show the Dungeon that you belong here.
- **Tier 5:** The Dungeon asks what you really want.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“A test reveals truth. You cannot lie with your rhythm.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.4 ENTERTAINMENT RATING — THE DUNGEON WATCHES YOU**

Every encounter modifies your **Entertainment Rating**, a hidden value the Dungeon tracks.

High Entertainment Rating grants:

- Bonus Veinscore
- Free Resolve
- Achievements
- Sudden gifts (Relics, Resolve Actions)
- Favorable UI anomalies (slow motion, hints)

Low Entertainment Rating triggers:

- Harder enemies
- More Interrupt attempts
- Less Resolve gain
- Dungeon mockery

### **Entertainment Rating rises when you:**

- Use Perfect Defense multiple times
- Run long, stylish chains
- Use Rhythm smartly (Balance → Heat → Momentum → Heat Burst)
- Execute dramatically
- Take risks while low HP

### **Entertainment Rating drops when you:**

- Play safe repeatedly
- Repeat the same action patterns
- Ignore Heat
- Never Parry or Dodge
- Fail to impress

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Dance for me. Or bleed for me. Either is fine.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.5 SIGNATURES, PASSIVES & META SLOTS**

As you level, you unlock:

### **Signature Slot (Level 7)**

One Path ability becomes your identity—enhanced, empowered.

### **Passive Slot (Level 8)**

A constant benefit from your Path or the Dungeon.

### **Perk Slot (Level 13)**

Universal mechanical tweaks.

### **Meta Ability Slot (Level 18)**

Break the rules. Literally.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“Yes… now you are worth observing.”
```

# ⭐ **11.6 RESOLVE GROWTH (New Scaling)**

Resolve maximum increases with Tiers:

| Tier  | Max Resolve |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **0** | 5           |
| **1** | 6           |
| **2** | 7           |
| **3** | 8           |
| **4** | 10          |
| **5** | 12          |

Resolve regen remains **3 per turn** unless modified.

---

# ⭐ **11.7 ATTRIBUTE GROWTH**

Every Attribute point matters. Most builds end with 3–6 extra points spent across the journey.

Upgrading an Attribute:

- Increases damage (POW/AGI/MND/SPR)
- Increases HP (POW only)
- Increases Pool size (each Path)
- Improves Rhythm interactions indirectly

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Power changes your story. Rhythm decides if you survive it.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.8 ACHIEVEMENTS & DUNGEON FAVOR**

Achievements grant:

- Veinscore
- Boons
- Relics
- Resolve Actions
- Entertainment Rating boosts

### Examples:

- **Rhythm Devotee:** Execute a chain of 5 actions without a miss.
- **Perfect Flow:** Perform 3 Perfect Defenses in one encounter.
- **Burning Soul:** Reach Heat 5 and survive.
- **Spite of Stone:** Kill a boss while Off‑Balance.
- **The Dungeon Laughs:** Trigger a Dungeon Favor message.

Achievements change how the Dungeon treats you—sometimes as a toy, sometimes as an apprentice.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“You amuse me. Take a gift.”
