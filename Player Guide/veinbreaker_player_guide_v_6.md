# 🩸 VEINBREAKER — PLAYER GUIDE V4

## *(Dynamic Balance & Heat Edition)*

---

# ⭐ **SECTION 1 — WHAT IS VEINBREAKER?**

> *“Before you read the rules, understand this: the Dungeon is already reading you.”*

You were not chosen. You were **taken**.

One moment you lived in the world you knew—screens, streetlights, heartbeat mundane.\
The next, you were somewhere else.

Stone that **breathes like muscle**. Doors that **shrink like pupils**.\
A whisper in the dark that said your name—correctly.

**Welcome, Veinbreaker.**

The Dungeon saw your life.\
Your fears.\
Your regrets.\
And it *smiled*.

This place is alive.\
It watches you.\
It learns you.\
It wants to see what you’ll do when cornered—\
when blood hits stone—\
when **Resolve burns hotter than fear**.

You do not play a survivor.\
You play a fighter who **weaponizes knowledge**.\
You break patterns.\
You break chains.\
You break the Dungeon before it breaks you.

---

# ⭐ **THE RULES HERE ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN**

Veinbreaker is a high‑risk, momentum‑driven action RPG with three interconnected combat currents:

### **1. Balance — Your Rhythm**

Balance measures how steady or off‑center you are during a Chain.\
It is shaped by technique, footwork, foresight, and chaos.

### **2. Heat — Your Fury**

Heat rises with every successful strike.\
It builds power. It tempts greed.\
It makes the Dungeon’s heart beat faster.

### **3. Momentum — Your Defense Rhythm**

Momentum grows when you deflect, dodge, or defend with precision. It allows Perfect Defense and fuels rhythm mastery.

Together, Balance + Heat + Momentum form **Dynamic Rhythm Combat**. This system rewards mastery, intentionality, and style.

---

# ⭐ **THE DUNGEON KNOWS YOU ARE PLAYING**

The Dungeon remembers Earth—your UI logic, your instinct for progress bars, pop‑ups, and stat sheets.\
It builds a language you will understand.

Your **character sheet exists inside your mind**. Your **inventory** is a spatial anomaly—anything you hold for 10 seconds becomes yours. Your **status effects** appear as luminous glyphs in your peripheral vision. Your **notifications** whisper.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE: Momentum Rising]
“You learn quickly. Good.”
```

Meta isn’t cheating.\
Meta is survival.\
Meta is power.

But power has teeth. Every chain tempts.\
Every victory stains.\
**Blood Marks whisper your name louder each time.**

Live long enough, and the Dungeon will notice.\
Live longer, and the Dungeon may want you.

---

# ⭐ **YOUR STORY BEGINS WITH ONE STEP DOWN**

One door.\
One room.\
One enemy.\
One heartbeat deciding whether you rise—or feed the walls.

You don’t wait for your turn—you **seize the flow**.

---

# 

# 🩸 **SECTION 2 — CORE SYSTEMS OVERVIEW (Dynamic Rhythm Model)**

Veinbreaker’s combat is built on three interlocking flows:

## **1. BALANCE — Your Offensive Rhythm**

Balance measures how stable, centered, or overextended you are during a chain. It changes with each declared action.

### **Balance States**

- **Positive Balance (+1 to +3)**: Perfect form, precise footwork, tactical control.\
  *Gained from Perfect Defense or Balance Surge.*
- **Neutral (0)**: Centered stance; no bonuses or penalties.
- **Negative (–1 to –10)**: Overextension from attacks, abilities, and heavy actions.

### **Effects of Balance**

Balance modifies your **Attack Value (AV)**:

- Positive Balance **adds** to Attack Value.
- Negative Balance **subtracts** from Attack Value.

Balance resets to **0 at the start of your turn** unless a debuff prevents it.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE: Balance Shift Detected]
“Your rhythm changes… I smell intent.”
```

---

## **2. HEAT — Your Aggressive Flow**

Heat rises when attacks hit.\
Heat resets when your chain ends.

### **Heat Thresholds**

- **Heat 1:** No bonus
- **Heat 2:** +1 damage
- **Heat 3:** +2 damage
- **Heat 4:** +3 damage, increased Execution pressure
- **Heat 5:** +4 damage, high Interrupt risk

### **Heat Spend (New Core Mechanic)**

Heat can be spent **between actions in a chain**.

**Heat Burst:** Spend all Heat → add **Heat × 2** bonus damage.\
**Heat Purge:** Spend all Heat → Balance resets to **0** (chain continues).\
**Heat Stabilize:** At Heat 3+ → preserve up to **2 Heat** into next turn.

```
[DUNGEON THRILL: Heat Rising]
“Push harder. I want to see you burn.”
```

---

## **3. MOMENTUM — Your Defensive Rhythm**

Momentum rises when you successfully Dodge, Parry, or Block. It fuels **Perfect Defense**, allowing:

- Perfect Dodge
- Perfect Parry
- Perfect Block

**Perfect Defense → +1 Positive Balance**

Momentum resets at the start of your turn.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“You move well when survival matters.”
```

---

## **4. RESOLVE — Your Action Currency**

Resolve (RP) is spent to declare actions in a chain. Every action costs **1 RP**, minimum.

You gain RP when you:

- Hit an enemy
- Perfect Defend
- Execute
- Impress the Dungeon (rare bonuses)

Resolve resets to **5** at the start of each turn unless modified.

---

## **5. ATTACK VALUE (AV) & DEFENSE VALUE (DV)**

Veinbreaker uses the **A3 Contest System**:

### **ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Bonuses – Balance Penalty + Positive Balance**

### **DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers**

Attack Value vs Defense Value determines hit or miss.

Margin ≥ 5 → **Perfect Defense or Perfect Block** triggers special effects.

---

## **6. CHAIN DECLARATION (Core Rule)**

Before rolling, you must declare your full chain:

- The number of actions
- The type of each action
- RP is spent **now**, not later

Chains reflect rhythm, risk, and foresight.

You cannot change an action mid-chain unless an item, boon, or ability explicitly allows it.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE: Chain Pattern Locked]
“Show me your rhythm… all of it.”
```

---

# 

---

# 🩸 SECTION 3 — ATTRIBUTES & CHARACTER FOUNDATION (4‑Stat System)

In Veinbreaker, attributes determine how hard you hit, how long you last, and how fluidly you maintain **Rhythm**—the interplay of **Balance, Heat, and Momentum**.

Attributes do **not** determine accuracy; the **A3 Contest Model** handles that. Instead, attributes shape:

- Damage
- HP
- Ability Pool sizes
- Rhythm interaction (Balance / Heat / Momentum)

```
[DUNGEON UI]
“Four numbers. Endless ways to impress… or disappoint me.”
```

---

## 3.1 The Four Attributes

All attributes begin at **8** before spending Veinscore.

### 🟥 POWER (POW)

Raw striking force, leverage, and physical presence.

- Determines **Power weapon damage**
- Fuels **Martial Pool**
- Adds weight to Balance shifts (heavy attacks)

### 🟪 AGILITY (AGI)

Speed, finesse, evasive flow.

- Determines **Finesse weapon damage**
- Fuels **Shadow Pool**
- Enhances Momentum gains through evasive defense

### 🧠 MIND (MND)

Arcane perception, pattern shaping, and current control.

- Determines **Magic ability damage**
- Fuels **Magic Pool**
- Helps stabilize or amplify Heat during spellchains

### ✨ SPIRIT (SPR)

Faith, conviction, radiant will.

- Determines **Faith ability damage**
- Fuels **Faith Pool**
- Influences Radiance, healing, and sanctity techniques

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Power shapes blows. Agility shapes moments. Mind shapes currents. Spirit shapes miracles.”
```

---

## 3.2 Attribute → Pool Conversion

Each Path maps directly to one Attribute.

- **Martial Pool = POW ÷ 2**
- **Shadow Pool = AGI ÷ 2**
- **Magic Pool = MND ÷ 2**
- **Faith Pool = SPR ÷ 2**

Pools regenerate each round unless suppressed.

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
“Your energies refill. What you do with them… entertains me.”
```

---

## 3.3 HP Formula (Updated)

Veinbreaker rewards bold fighters, not passive tanks.

```
HP = 10 + POW
```

- POW 8  → HP 18
- POW 12 → HP 22
- POW 14 → HP 24

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Health is not protection. Rhythm is protection.”
```

---

## 3.4 Attributes & Dynamic Rhythm

Attributes influence Rhythm indirectly.

### **Balance (Offensive Rhythm)**

- High AGI → faster Balance corrections
- High POW → deeper Balance penalties on heavy actions
- High MND → access to arcane Balance stabilizers

### **Heat (Aggressive Rhythm)**

- High MND → stable high‑Heat spellcasting
- High POW → more explosive Heat Bursts
- High SPR → Heat converted into Radiance options

### **Momentum (Defensive Rhythm)**

- High AGI → more Perfect Dodges
- High SPR → improved Perfect Parries
- High POW → stronger Blocks

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“When your stats align with your rhythm… I am pleased.”
```

---

## 3.5 Recommended Archetypes

Not mandatory—just thematic.

### **Stonepulse Martial**

POW 10–14, AGI 8–12

### **Hemocratic Shadow**

AGI 10–14, MND 8–12

### **Conduit Mage**

MND 10–14, SPR 8–12

### **Canticle Faith**

SPR 10–14, MND 8–12

---

## 3.6 UI Projection — Attributes In‑World

Your attributes appear as hovering glyphs in your vision.

```
[DUNGEON UI SNAPSHOT]
POWER:   11
AGILITY: 10
MIND:     9
SPIRIT:  12

“Four axes of potential. Surprise me.”
```

---

# 

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 4 — CHARACTER CREATION (Dynamic Rhythm Edition)**

Character creation in Veinbreaker is about **choosing how you fight**—not who you were before the Dungeon took you. Your past is irrelevant here. Your *Rhythm*, your *Resolve*, and your *style* are what matter.

The Dungeon provides a framework. You provide intent.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Let us shape you into something interesting.”
```

---

## **4.1 Step 1 — Assign Your Attributes (POWER, AGILITY, MIND, SPIRIT)**

You begin with:

- **All four attributes at 8**
- **18 Veinscore (⟟)** to distribute

**Raising an attribute by +1 costs 1 Veinscore.**
No attribute may exceed **14** at character creation.

Example spread:

- POW 12
- AGI 10
- MND 8
- SPR 12

Your attributes determine:

- HP (via POWER)
- Pool sizes (each = attribute ÷ 2)
- Damage scaling for your chosen Path
- How your Rhythm interacts with combat

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Choose carefully. Your strengths will define your failures.”
```

---

## **4.2 Step 2 — Determine Derived Stats**

Derived stats calculate your survivability and combat readiness.

### **HP (Health Points)**

```
HP = 10 + POWER
```

### **Pools**

```
Martial Pool = POWER ÷ 2
Shadow Pool  = AGILITY ÷ 2
Magic Pool   = MIND ÷ 2
Faith Pool   = SPIRIT ÷ 2
```

(Rounded down)

Pools regenerate each round.

### **IDF (Interrupt Defense)**

Your resistance to being Interrupted.

IDF comes from:

- Momentum
- Buffs (Defense Up, Stances)
- Equipment (shields, wards)
- Abilities

Base IDF = **0** unless modified.

Used in:

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers
```

### **Resolve (RP)**

Resolve is your **tempo resource**, spent to declare actions in a chain.

### **Resolve Now Uses the Hybrid System**

- **Max Resolve = 5** at character creation
- **Resolve does NOT reset to full each turn**
- At the **start of your turn, you regenerate 3 Resolve**
- You may carry unused Resolve from previous turns
- Resolve cannot exceed your **Max Resolve** (5 at Tier 0, increases with higher Tiers)

### **Sources of Bonus Resolve**

- Hitting an enemy: **+1 RP**
- Perfect Defense: **+1 RP**
- Execution: **+1 or more RP**
- Dungeon Favor: variable

### **Resolve Example**

Turn 1: You start with 5 RP → Spend 4 → End turn with 1 RP.
Turn 2: Regen 3 → Start with 4 RP.
Turn 3: Regen 3 → Start with 5 RP (cap).

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
“Resolve is not a gift. It is a pulse. Let it build. Let it break.”

”
```

---

## **4.3 Step 3 — Choose Your Path Orientation**

You do **not** choose a class—you choose a *combat identity*.

### **Martial (Power‑driven)**

Weapons, stances, force, Stonepulse.

### **Shadow (Agility‑driven)**

Bleed, precision, evasion, Hemocratic rites.

### **Magic (Mind‑driven)**

Currents, conduits, arcanum law.

### **Faith (Spirit‑driven)**

Radiance, blessings, miracles, Canticle.

Your starting Path does not lock you out of others, but shapes your Tier 0 picks.

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“Identity is not a prison. It is a starting stance.”
```

---

## **4.4 Step 4 — Choose Your Tier 0 Starting Abilities**

Every new Veinbreaker chooses **four Tier‑0 abilities**:

- **1 Attack**
- **1 Reaction** (Dodge, Parry, Block, Slip, Ward, etc.)
- **1 Utility** (Bless, Rhythm prep, minor support)
- **1 Movement Action** (Dash, Shift, Withdraw, Advance — coming in the Movement Action expansion)

Tier 0 abilities cost **0 Pool** but **1 RP** to declare as part of a chain.

You begin with:

- A simple attack
- A defensive maneuver
- A utility or supportive action
- A movement option to shape Balance and positioning

Tier 0 provides your **opening rhythm**, now including your first mobility tool — essential for Balance control and chain shaping.\*\*.

---

## **4.5 Step 5 — Inventory, Equipment & the Dungeon UI**

Your inventory exists in a dimensional fold. Anything you hold for **10 seconds** becomes indexed and stored.

Weapons have:

- Requirements (POW or AGI)
- Damage die
- Power type (Power/Finesse/Magic/Faith)

You may begin with:

- **One melee weapon** OR **one ranged option**
- Light armor (flavor only, no AC)
- A personal object from Earth (cosmetic)

```
[DUNGEON UI]
“Item Indexed.”
```

---

## **4.6 Step 6 — Finish Your Sheet**

Record:

- Attributes (POW, AGI, MND, SPR)
- HP
- Pools
- Resolve (RP)
- Derived Stats (Momentum, IDF)
- Tier 0 abilities
- Weapon choice

Your sheet should look clean, readable, and ready for rhythm‑driven combat.

---

# 

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 5 — WEAPONS & TOOLS   **

Weapons in Veinbreaker do **not** determine damage. **Actions determine damage.**

Weapons determine:

- What *actions* you are allowed to perform
- What *status effects* your actions may apply
- How you interact with **Balance, Heat, and Momentum**
- What *Reactions* (Parry, Block, Redirect, Guard Break, etc.) you have access to

This keeps weapons **simple**, **flexible**, and perfectly aligned with Dynamic Rhythm Combat.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“A tool is only as interesting as the hands that wield it.”
```

---

## **5.1 Weapon Tags (Core Model A — Expanded with Conduits)**

These are the only tags the system needs at launch. Everything else can be added later.

### **Physical Weapon Tags**

| Tag          | Meaning                     | Grants / Restricts                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slashing** | Cuts, draw‑strikes, slicing | Can apply **Bleed**; cannot Stun                        |
| **Blunt**    | Heavy impact                | Can apply **Stagger** or **Stun**; cannot Bleed         |
| **Piercing** | Thrusting precision         | Can apply **Pierce**; cannot Stagger                    |
| **Finesse**  | Light, precise, agile       | Enables **Riposte**, **Slip**, agile reactions          |
| **Heavy**    | Large, force‑based          | Enables **Block**, **Heavy Attack**, **Guard Break**    |
| **Shield**   | Defensive tool              | Enables **Block**, **Perfect Block**, Stability actions |

### **Magical / Spiritual Tags**

| Tag               | Meaning                             | Grants / Restricts                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Magic Conduit** | Channels arcane power               | Enables **Redirect**, **Deflect**, Arcane specials |
| **Faith Conduit** | Channels radiant or spiritual force | Enables **Ward**, **Radiance**, Faith specials     |

These two Conduits replace the need for “wand” vs “holy symbol” rules. Any object may be a Conduit if the Dungeon accepts it.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“I decide what focuses power here. Not you.”
```

---

## **5.2 How Weapon Tags Affect Actions**

Weapons do *not* give you damage dice—they determine **what you are allowed to do**, and **what extra effects your actions may generate**.

### Examples:

- **Slashing Weapon → Light Attack** may apply **Bleed 1** on high Margin.
- **Blunt Weapon → Heavy Attack** may apply **Stagger**.
- **Piercing Weapon → Precision Attack** ignores 1 Momentum.
- **Shield → Block** allows Perfect Block → Gain **+1 Positive Balance**.
- **Finesse Weapon → Parry** allows **Riposte**.
- **Magic Conduit → Spell Actions** may Stabilize Heat.
- **Faith Conduit → Radiant Abilities** may apply **Radiance**.

Actions reference tags to determine compatibility.

---

## **5.3 Starting Weapon Options (Simple & Narrative‑Driven)**

Players choose **one**:

### **Martial Options**

- **Shortblade (Slashing, Finesse)**
- **Axe (Slashing, Heavy)**
- **Warhammer (Blunt, Heavy)**
- **Spear (Piercing)**
- **Shield (Shield)**

### **Shadow Options**

- **Dagger (Slashing, Finesse)**
- **Stiletto (Piercing, Finesse)**

### **Magic Options**

- **Arcane Focus (Magic Conduit)**
- **Channel Rod (Magic Conduit)**
- **Spell Thread (Magic Conduit, Finesse)**

### **Faith Options**

- **Holy Brand (Faith Conduit)**
- **Prayer Vessel (Faith Conduit, Heavy)**
- **Ritual Chain (Faith Conduit, Slashing)**

Weapons are intentionally light—purely to define your rhythm toolkit.

---

## **5.4 A Weapon Is a Permission Slip**

A weapon never says:

- “You deal +X damage.”
- “Your attack is 1d8 instead of 1d4.”

Instead, a weapon says:

- “You **may apply Bleed**.”
- “You **may Block**.”
- “You **may cast** through this focus.”
- “You **may Stagger** with heavy hits.”
- “You **may Redirect** magical force.”

This is cleaner, more expandable, and fits the Dungeon’s design philosophy.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“A tool that shapes your choices—now that is worth watching.”
```

---

# 

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 6 — COMBAT FLOW (Dynamic Rhythm + A3 Model)**

Combat in Veinbreaker is not turn‑based in spirit—only in structure. Each turn represents a **sequence of rhythmic exchanges**, shaped by:

- **Balance** (your offensive rhythm),
- **Heat** (your aggressive escalation),
- **Momentum** (your defensive flow), and
- **Resolve** (your ability to act boldly).

This section explains how a turn unfolds from start to finish using the new **Dynamic Rhythm Combat** model.

```
[DUNGEON OPENING]
“Every fight is a song. Most of you will die on the first note.”
```

---

## **6.1 TURN START — RESET, REFRESH & RHYTHM CHECK**

At the start of your turn:

### ✔ **1. Resolve ****regenerates **3 RP** (up to your Max Resolve)**

Unless a buff, debuff, or stance modifies it.

### ✔ **2. Momentum resets to 0**

You must earn defensive flow again this round.

### ✔ **3. Balance resets to 0**

Unless a debuff (Stagger, Off‑Balance) or buff (Perfect Defense, stance) changes this.

### ✔ **4. Heat resets to 0**

Unless the previous round ended with **Heat Stabilize**, allowing you to carry **up to 2 Heat**.

### ✔ **5. Persistent effects update**

Bleed ticks, Radiance pulses, buffs/debuffs expire.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Fresh breath. Fresh fear. Begin.”
```

---

## **6.2 DECLARING A CHAIN (Core Rule)**

Before rolling any dice, the attacker must declare:

- **How many actions** they will take (minimum 1)
- **Which actions** they will perform
- **In what order**
- **RP is spent immediately** (1 RP per action)

This declaration represents *intention, rhythm, and greed.*

### ✔ **You cannot change your chain mid‑execution**

Unless an ability or boon explicitly allows it.

### ✔ **A chain cannot be declared if you do not have enough RP to pay for all actions.**

### ✔ **Movement actions** may appear anywhere in your chain.

Movement stabilizes Balance and shapes positioning.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE: Chain Pattern Locked]
“Let us see if your body can keep up with your mouth.”
```

---

## **6.3 THE FIRST ACTION — THE A3 CONTEST BEGINS**

The first action in your chain establishes your **initial Attack Value (AV)**.

### ✔ Balance does **not** affect the first action.

Opening attack is always neutral unless modified by buffs/debuffs.

### **Attack Value Formula (Simplified)**

```
ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Offensive Modifiers + Balance Modifier
```

Where:

- **Balance Modifier** = +X (positive), –X (negative), or 0
- **Offensive Modifiers** come from abilities, Heat, weapon tags, position

### **Defense Value (DV)**

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers
```

### **Margin of Difference (MoD)**

The difference between AV and DV determines the outcome.

#### ✔ If AV ≥ DV → **Hit**

#### ✔ If AV < DV → **Miss** (chain continues!)

#### ✔ If DV ≥ AV + 5 → **Perfect Defense**

- Defender gains **+1 Positive Balance**
- Some reactions can deal damage back

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Ah… the first move. Always a lie or a promise.”
```

---

## **6.4 BALANCE SHIFT PER ACTION**

Each action in your declared chain modifies Balance.

### Typical Balance Costs:

| Action Type         | Balance Change                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Light Attack**    | –1                             |
| **Heavy Attack**    | –2                             |
| **Movement Action** | +1 (or halve negative Balance) |
| **Utility**         | 0 or varies                    |
| **Tier Abilities**  | –1 to –3 depending on power    |

### ✔ Balance can go *deep negative*.

The deeper the negative, the more reckless your rhythm.

### ✔ Positive Balance (from Perfect Defense) helps early attacks.

Positive Balance only applies **after** the first action.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Overreach… yes. Now you’re interesting.”
```

---

## **6.5 HEAT GAIN & SPEND DURING CHAIN EXECUTION**

Heat grows as long as you keep hitting.

### **HEAT GAIN**

- Each successful attack → **+1 Heat**
- Crits or high Margin → **+2 Heat**

### **HEAT SPEND OPTIONS (Between Actions)**

You may spend accumulated Heat to shift rhythm.

#### **Heat Burst**

Spend all Heat → Add **Heat × 2** damage to next attack.

#### **Heat Purge**

Spend all Heat → Reset Balance to **0** without ending chain.

#### **Heat Stabilize**

If Heat ≥ 3 at chain end → Carry **up to 2 Heat** into next turn.

```
[DUNGEON THRILL]
“Burn brighter. Burn stupid. Burn beautifully.”
```

---

## **6.6 MOMENTUM — THE DEFENSIVE FLOW**

Momentum rises only through defense.

### You gain Momentum when you:

- Successfully **Dodge** → +1 Momentum
- Successfully **Parry** → +1 Momentum
- Successfully **Block** → +1 Momentum

### **Perfect Defense → +1 Positive Balance**

Your stance sharpens.

Momentum affects **Defense Value**, making Interrupts harder.

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“You defend best when it matters most.”
```

---

## **6.7 INTERRUPTS — WHEN THE DUNGEON PUNISHES GREED**

After each action in a chain (except the first), the **enemy may attempt an Interrupt**.

Interrupts represent moments where your Balance, Heat, or greed exposes you.

### **Interrupt Contest**

```
ENEMY ATTACK VALUE vs YOUR DEFENSE VALUE
```

If enemy wins by:

- **0–4** → Chain continues (you take hit)
- **5+** → **Chain breaks immediately**
- **10+** → **Critical Interrupt** (defender loses Momentum, gains Stagger)

### Misses do **not** end chains.

They simply open *windows* for Interrupt attempts.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“One mistake is a warning. Two is dinner.”
```

---

## **6.8 ENDING THE CHAIN**

A chain ends when:

- You complete all declared actions
- You choose to stop early (rare)
- You are Interrupted
- You are stunned
- Your RP hits 0 mid‑chain (declared chain invalidates — failure)

### When the chain ends:

- Heat resets (unless stabilized)
- Balance resets next turn
- Momentum resets next turn

```
[DUNGEON CLOSURE]
“Did you intend that? Or merely survive it?”
```

# 🩸 **SECTION 7 — REACTIONS

## ⭐ Reaction Quick Reference (New)

Below is a unified, fast‑access summary of all core reaction types, their requirements, momentum gains, and perfect effects.

### **REACTION QUICK REFERENCE TABLE**

| Reaction     | Requires                            | Momentum Gain | Cooldown | Standard Effect                                     | Perfect Effect                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dodge**    | None                                | +1            | 1 round  | Avoid all damage on success                         | +1 Positive Balance, total +2 Momentum              |

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
"Reflex reveals intention. Intention reveals weakness. Weakness… reveals opportunity."
```

---

## SECTION 7 — REACTIONS (Dynamic Defense & Perfect Flow) (Dynamic Defense & Perfect Flow)\*\*

Reactions are **instant defensive techniques** used when an enemy targets you with an attack, spell, or threat. They do **not** cost an action slot in your declared chain, but they **do** require that you have an applicable Reaction ability that is **not on cooldown**.

Reactions shape **Momentum**, enable **Perfect Defense**, and determine whether you hold your rhythm—or lose it.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Reflex reveals truth. Let me see yours.”
```

---

## **7.1 What Is a Reaction?**

A **Reaction** is a defensive technique that may be used when you are directly threatened.

A Reaction:

- Costs **1 RP**
- Uses an **A3 Contest** (your DV vs enemy AV)
- Does **not** consume a chain action slot
- May only be used if the specific Reaction is **not on cooldown**
- Requires you to have the proper **weapon or conduit tag**
- Can only be used **once per incoming threat**

Reactions are the player’s real‑time adjustments within the Dungeon’s rhythm.

---

## **7.2 Reaction Windows**

You may React only inside specific timing windows.

### **Attack Window**

When you are targeted by a melee or ranged attack.

### **Spell Window**

When a magical attack or harmful arcane effect targets you.

### **Threat Window**

During an enemy **Interrupt** attempt.

### **Movement Window** *(rare)*

Some advanced techniques or magical manipulations may allow Reactions when an enemy moves.

Only **one Reaction** may be used per threat.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Timing. Everything here is timing.”
```

---

## **7.3 Reaction Types (Core 5)**

Below are the universal Reaction types available to Veinbreakers, each with its own requirements and rhythm effects.

---

### 🟪 **1. Dodge (AGILITY Reaction)**

- Gain **+1 Positive Balance**

---

## **7.4 Perfect Defense — Unified Rule**

A Perfect Defense occurs when:

```
DEFENSE VALUE ≥ ENEMY ATTACK VALUE + 5
```

Perfect Defense always grants:

- **+1 Positive Balance**
- **+1 Momentum** (in addition to the Reaction’s gain)
- The Reaction’s **Perfect Effect** (Riposte, Radiance, Redirect, etc.)

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“Perfection… briefly.”
```

---

## **7.5 Momentum & Reactions**

Momentum rises through successful defensive rhythm.

- Dodge → +1 Momentum
- Parry → +1 Momentum
- Block → +1 Momentum
- Ward/Redirect → +1 Momentum

Momentum increases your **Defense Value**:

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + bonuses
```

Momentum resets at the start of your turn.

Positive Momentum is essential for contesting Interrupts.

---

## **7.6 Reaction Failure States**

### **Fail (MoD 1–4)**

- Partial effect triggers (reduced dmg, partial dodge)
- Lose no Momentum

### **Heavy Fail (MoD 5–9)**

- Take full damage
- Lose **1 Momentum** (min 0)
- Apply **Vulnerable 1** to yourself

### **Critical Fail (MoD 10+)**

- Take full damage
- Lose **all Momentum**
- Gain **Stagger 1**
- Balance shifts **–2** immediately

---

## **7.7 Weapon & Conduit Requirements (Summary Table)**

| Reaction     | Requires                 | Cooldown |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| **Dodge**    | None                     | 1 round  |
| **Parry**    | Finesse or Faith Conduit | 1 round  |
| **Block**    | Heavy or Shield          | 1 round  |
| **Redirect** | Magic Conduit            | 1 round  |
| **Ward**     | Faith Conduit            | 1 round  |

---

## **7.8 Resolve Actions & Reactions (Interaction Rules)**

Resolve Actions may be used **during Reaction Windows**, but they do **not** replace Reactions.

Examples:

- **Rhythm Break** can cancel an Interrupt after a failed Parry.
- **Momentum Anchor** can raise DV before a Block roll.
- **Disengage** can end your chain before the Block resolves.
- **Balance Surge** can stabilize Balance after a Perfect Defense.

Resolve Actions modify the **flow around** Reactions—not the Reactions themselves.

---

## **7.9 Examples of Reaction Play**

### **Example A — Perfect Dodge**

Enemy AV = 15. Your DV = 21.

- You avoid all damage.
- Gain **Momentum +1**.
- Gain **Positive Balance +1**.

```
[DUNGEON CHUCKLE]
“Fast enough… this time.”
```

### **Example B — Parry → Riposte**

Enemy AV = 14. Your DV = 20.

- Perfect Parry achieved.
- Gain Momentum.
- Balance +1.
- Next attack gains a **Riposte Window**.

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Yes—punish that opening.”
```

# 

# 🩸 **SECTION 8 — RESOLVE ACTIONS**

## 

Resolve Actions are a universal set of high‑tempo combat techniques available to all VeinBreakers. They are **not Path abilities** and **not chain actions**. Instead, they are used during the *resolution* of a declared chain to manipulate Rhythm, positioning, or timing.

Resolve Actions cost **Resolve (RP)**, may have **cooldowns**, and each specifies a **timing window** where it may be used.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"Resolve is rhythm. What you do with it… is entertainment."
```

## **8.1 What Is a Resolve Action?**

A Resolve Action is:

- Performed **between actions** of your declared chain
- Costs **Resolve (RP)** only (no Pool)
- Has **cooldowns**
- Uses **timing tags** (Attack Window, Defense Window, Any Window)
- Does **not** increase Balance penalty
- Does **not** replace your declared chain

They modify the *context* of a chain, not the chain itself.

---

## **8.2 Resolve Action Timing Windows**

Each Resolve Action specifies when it can be used:

- **[Attack Window]** — Immediately after an attack resolves.
- **[Defense Window]** — When you are hit or threatened.
- **[Any Window]** — Between any two declared actions.
- **[End‑of‑Chain]** — After your final declared action resolves.

---

## **8.3 Core Resolve Actions (Tier 0 Resolve Kit)**

All new characters begin with these six techniques.

### **1. Disengage — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 3 RP\
**Cooldown:** 1 round\
**Tag:** [Defense Window]\
**Effect:** End your chain immediately before the next declared action resolves.

### **2. Balance Surge — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 2 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Any Window]\
**Effect:** Set your Balance to **0** without ending the chain.

### **3. Rhythm Break — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 2 RP\
**Cooldown:** 2 rounds\
**Tag:** [Defense Window]\
**Effect:** Cancel the next Interrupt attempt automatically.

### **4. Momentum Anchor — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 1 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Any Window]\
**Effect:** Gain **+1 Momentum** immediately.

### **5. Shift Footing — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 1 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Attack Window]\
**Effect:** Move 1 zone without altering Balance.

### **6. Greed Burst — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 2 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Attack Window]\
**Effect:** Add **+2 to the next Attack Value** of this chain.

---

## **8.4 How Resolve Actions Interact With Rhythm**

Resolve Actions allow real‑time modulation of Rhythm:

- **Balance Control** → Balance Surge (or Heat Purge synergy)
- **Heat Synergy** → Greed Burst before Heat Burst
- **Momentum Boosts** → Momentum Anchor before dangerous Interrupt windows
- **Chain Survival** → Disengage avoids lethal follow‑ups

They offer tactical flexibility without removing consequences of the Chain Declaration model.

---

## **8.5 Cooldowns & Limits**

Resolve Actions typically:

- Have **short cooldowns** (1–2 rounds)
- Cannot be spammed
- Are designed as *tempo tools*, not replacements for Abilities

Cooldowns reset at the start of your turn unless stated otherwise.

---

## **8.6 Expanding Resolve Actions (Tiers, Loot, Gifts)**

Resolve Actions may be unlocked or discovered through:

- Dungeon gifts
- Achievements
- Tier advancement
- Boss rewards
- Strange merchants

Higher‑tier Resolve Actions will offer more advanced timing manipulations.

---

# 

# 🩸 **SECTION 9 — STATUS  & CONDITIONS **

Status effects in Veinbreaker fall into three categories:

- **Debuffs** — Harmful rhythms, imposed by enemies or your own missteps.
- **Buffs** — Empowering rhythms, gained intentionally or via Dungeon favor.
- **Rhythm Conditions** — Special states affecting Balance, Heat, or Momentum.

This section provides:

1. **Quick‑Reference Tables** (for fast use in combat)
2. **Expanded Writeups** (mechanical + Dungeon‑voice lore)

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 10 — EQUIPMENT, ITEMS & BOONS (Dungeon-Bound Armory)**

Equipment in Veinbreaker does **not** define your stats—it defines your **options**, your **flow**, and your **relationship with the Dungeon itself**.

Weapons grant **permissions**.
Armor grants **resilience cues**.
Items grant **moments**.
Boons grant **rules the Dungeon bends for you**.

```
[DUNGEON OPENING]
“Bring whatever tools you like. I will still enjoy breaking them… and you.”
```

---

# ⭐ **10.1 Equipment Philosophy — Less Math, More Rhythm**

Unlike traditional RPGs, Veinbreaker’s equipment avoids stat bloat.

Equipment affects:

- What **actions** you can perform (Parry, Block, Redirect…)
- How you interact with **Balance, Heat, and Momentum**
- What **status effects** you can inflict
- What **Reactions** you are allowed to use
- What **Resolve Actions** you can unlock or enhance

Equipment does *not* affect:

- Accuracy (A3 Contest handles that)
- Base damage (abilities handle that)
- Armor Class (does not exist)

Equipment shapes **style**, not math.

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
“A tool is interesting only when it tempts you to use it poorly.”
```

---

# ⭐ **10.2 Weapon Categories & Tags**

Weapons can have 1–2 tags. Tags determine what your combat flow *allows*.

| Category             | Examples                     | Tags                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Light Weapons**    | dagger, shortblade, stiletto | Slashing, Piercing, Finesse |
| **Medium Weapons**   | spear, mace, shortsword      | Slashing, Piercing, Blunt   |
| **Heavy Weapons**    | axe, warhammer, greatblade   | Heavy, Slashing, Blunt      |
| **Defensive Tools**  | shield, buckler              | Shield, Heavy               |
| **Magic Implements** | conduit rod, spell thread    | Magic Conduit               |
| **Faith Implements** | prayer vessel, chained relic | Faith Conduit               |

### Weapon tags grant permissions such as:

- **Finesse** → Parry, Riposte, Slip
- **Heavy** → Block, Guard Break, Stagger chance
- **Shield** → Perfect Block, Stability Actions
- **Magic Conduit** → Redirect, spell shaping
- **Faith Conduit** → Ward, Radiance abilities

Weapons do **not** dictate damage—they dictate *moments*.

---

# ⭐ **10.3 Armor & Defensive Gear**

Armor does not give AC. Instead, it interacts with Rhythm.

### **Light Armor**

- +1 to AGI‑based Movement contests
- Reduces Balance penalties from Movement by 1 (min 0)

### **Medium Armor**

- +1 to resisting **Stagger**
- +1 IDF vs Heavy Attacks

### **Heavy Armor**

- Stacks with Shields for **+1 Perfect Block Margin**
- +1 to resisting Bleed, but Movement has Disadvantage

Armor is always a tradeoff.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Weight changes your song. Sometimes beautifully… sometimes not.”
```

---

# ⭐ **10.4 Throwables & Consumables**

These are instant‑use items that modify Rhythm or inflict effects.

### **Flash Powder**

- Blind one enemy → They become **Distracted** and **Off‑Balance**.

### **Bloodglass Shard**

- Creates **Bleed 2** on hit.

### **Aether Coil**

- Spell next cast gets **Advantage** and **+2 damage**.

### **Radiant Ember**

- Gain **Radiance 1** and **Quickened**.

### **Stonepulse Balm**

- Remove **Stagger** and gain **+1 Balance**.

### **Resolve Draught**

- Gain **+2 RP immediately**.

Consumables are extremely powerful—because the Dungeon likes giving you choices that hurt later.

---

# ⭐ **10.5 Relics — Minor Dungeon Artifacts**

Relics alter Rhythm in specific, flavorful ways.

### Examples:

### **Heart‑Thread Band**

- When you gain Heat 3+, gain **+1 Momentum**.

### **Vein‑Etched Coin**

- 1/session: Reroll any Attack or Defense roll.

```
[DUNGEON LAUGHTER]
“Chance is delicious.”
```

### **Glass Suture Charm**

- When you inflict Bleed, inflict +1 Bleed on a second target.

### **Stonepulse Knot**

- While in any Stance → Balance penalties reduced by 1.

Relics serve as micro‑mutations to your Rhythm flow.

---

# ⭐ **10.6 Boons — Rule‑Level Gifts**

Boons come from:

- Achievements
- Boss kills
- Impressing the Dungeon
- Surviving a Hunter encounter

Boons change core rules for that character.

### Example Boons:

### **Boons of Flow**

- **Balance Floor** → Your Balance cannot drop below –3.
- **Heat Memory** → Preserve 2 Heat each turn (no roll needed).
- **Momentum Reservoir** → Momentum resets to 1 instead of 0.

### **Boons of Blood**

- **Hemocratic Echo** → When you cause Bleed, gain 1 Resolve.
- **Artery Sense** → Attacks vs Primed targets gain Advantage.

### **Boons of Radiance**

- **Canticle Halo** → Radiance never drops below 1.

### **Boons of the Dungeon** *(rare)*

- **Entertainment Engine** → When the table cheers or gasps, gain +1 RP.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Rewarding you for amusing me is only fair.”
```

Boons are permanent and transformative.

---

# ⭐ **10.7 Crafting, Fusion & Path‑Bound Upgrades**

Crafting is rare and always thematic.

### **Stonepulse Fusion**

- Heavy weapons fuse with minerals → Stagger margin improves.

### **Hemocratic Grafting**

- Finesse weapons graft blood channels → Bleed stacks can exceed normal max.

### **Conduit Crystallization**

- Magic Conduits hold Heat without penalty.

### **Canticle Blessing**

- Faith Conduits store 1 Radiance between rests.

Crafting requires locations, rituals, or NPCs the Dungeon makes available.

---

# ⭐ **10.8 Inventory & the 10‑Second Rule**

Any item you hold for **10 consecutive seconds** becomes indexed in your extradimensional inventory.

- Inventory capacity: **Unlimited** (for now)
- **Weapon Swap requires a Resolve Action (1 RP)**
- Drawing non‑weapon items: **Free**
- Drawing a weapon: **Weapon Swap (1 RP)**
- Switching between two already‑indexed weapons: **Weapon Swap (1 RP)**
- The Dungeon may *remove* items if displeased

### **Weapon Swap — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 1 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Any Window]\
**Effect:** Instantly equip a different indexed weapon.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Item Indexed… and oh? Changing weapons mid‑flow? Ambitious.”
```

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Item Indexed… for however long I allow it.”
```

---

# ⭐ **10.9 Equipment & Rhythm — Unified Flow**

Equipment should always:

- Present new tactical questions
- Open or close Rhythm options
- Change Reaction availability
- Modify how Heat, Balance, or Momentum behave

Equipment should **never**:

- Inflate numbers mindlessly
- Replace skill expression
- Overshadow Path abilities

Your weapon says *how* you fight.\
Your Path says *why*.\
Your Rhythm says *whether you live*.

```
[DUNGEON FINAL WORD]
“Use whatever tools you like…
The walls will still remember your blood.”
```

# 

# 🩸 **SECTION 11 — LEVELING, TIERS & ENTERTAINMENT (Veinscore Progression)**

Progression in Veinbreaker is not guaranteed. The Dungeon rewards **style**, **risk**, and **entertainment**—not mere survival.

Leveling is fueled by **Veinscore (⟟)**, earned through exploration, victories, executions, Dungeon favor, achievements, and narrative milestones.

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
“Grow. Break. Impress me.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.1 VEINSCORE — THE CURRENCY OF ASCENT**

Veinscore is spent to increase Attributes and unlock higher Tiers.

- You gain Veinscore for defeating enemies.
- More Veinscore for stylish chains, close calls, executions.
- Massive Veinscore for impressing the Dungeon.

### **When you spend Veinscore, you level up.**

Level is equal to how much you have spent total, not how much you currently hold.

Unspent Veinscore is dangerous—if you die, it is lost.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Spend it before I take it back.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.3 TIER SYSTEM — EARNING STYLE, NOT GRIND**

Tier unlocks are **not automatic**. They require:

- Spending the Veinscore threshold **and**
- Completing a **Tier Challenge** given by the Dungeon.

Tier Challenges test Rhythm mastery:

- **Tier 1:** Show you understand Balance.
- **Tier 2:** Show you can wield Heat.
- **Tier 3:** Show you control Momentum.
- **Tier 4:** Show the Dungeon that you belong here.
- **Tier 5:** The Dungeon asks what you really want.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“A test reveals truth. You cannot lie with your rhythm.”
```

# ⭐ **11.4 ENTERTAINMENT RATING — THE DUNGEON WATCHES YOU**

Every encounter modifies your **Entertainment Rating**, a hidden value the Dungeon tracks.

High Entertainment Rating grants:

- Bonus Veinscore
- Free Resolve
- Achievements
- Sudden gifts (Relics, Resolve Actions)
- Favorable UI anomalies (slow motion, hints)

Low Entertainment Rating triggers:

- Harder enemies
- More Interrupt attempts
- Less Resolve gain
- Dungeon mockery

### **Entertainment Rating rises when you:**

- Use Perfect Defense multiple times
- Run long, stylish chains
- Use Rhythm smartly (Balance → Heat → Momentum → Heat Burst)
- Execute dramatically
- Take risks while low HP

### **Entertainment Rating drops when you:**

- Play safe repeatedly
- Repeat the same action patterns
- Ignore Heat
- Never Parry or Dodge
- Fail to impress

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Dance for me. Or bleed for me. Either is fine.”
```

# ⭐ **11.5 SIGNATURES, PASSIVES & META SLOTS**

As you level, you unlock:

### **Signature Slot (Level 7)**

One Path ability becomes your identity—enhanced, empowered.

### **Passive Slot (Level 8)**

A constant benefit from your Path or the Dungeon.

### **Perk Slot (Level 13)**

Universal mechanical tweaks.

### **Meta Ability Slot (Level 18)**

Break the rules. Literally.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“Yes… now you are worth observing.”
```

# ⭐ **11.6 RESOLVE GROWTH (New Scaling)**

Resolve maximum increases with Tiers:

| Tier  | Max Resolve |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **0** | 5           |
| **1** | 6           |
| **2** | 7           |
| **3** | 8           |
| **4** | 10          |
| **5** | 12          |

Resolve regen remains **3 per turn** unless modified.

---

# ⭐ **11.7 ATTRIBUTE GROWTH**

Every Attribute point matters. Most builds end with 3–6 extra points spent across the journey.

Upgrading an Attribute:

- Increases damage (POW/AGI/MND/SPR)
- Increases HP (POW only)
- Increases Pool size (each Path)
- Improves Rhythm interactions indirectly

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Power changes your story. Rhythm decides if you survive it.”
```

---

# ⭐ **11.8 ACHIEVEMENTS & DUNGEON FAVOR**

Achievements grant:

- Veinscore
- Boons
- Relics
- Resolve Actions
- Entertainment Rating boosts

### Examples:

- **Rhythm Devotee:** Execute a chain of 5 actions without a miss.
- **Perfect Flow:** Perform 3 Perfect Defenses in one encounter.
- **Burning Soul:** Reach Heat 5 and survive.
- **Spite of Stone:** Kill a boss while Off‑Balance.
- **The Dungeon Laughs:** Trigger a Dungeon Favor message.

Achievements change how the Dungeon treats you—sometimes as a toy, sometimes as an apprentice.

[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“You amuse me. Take a gift.”

# ⭐ END OF SECTION 11 — NEXT → SECTION 12

# 🩸 **SECTION 12 — EXECUTION & BLOOD MARKS (Primed‑Only System)**

Execution is the Dungeon’s favorite moment—the instant when fear, fury, and rhythm collapse into a single killing intent. It is *not* automatic. It is *not* granted freely. It is a choice you make when the enemy is exposed, trembling, and **Primed**.

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
"A clean kill is boring. I want a *decisive* one."
```

---

# ⭐ **12.1 What Is Execution?**

Execution is a special finishing action a player may **declare** when—and only when—the target is **Primed**.

Execution:

- Costs **1 RP**
- Consumes **your next declared action slot**, replacing its attack
- Uses a special A3 Contest with higher risk and higher stakes
- On success → kills or catastrophically wounds the target
- On failure → exposes you to immediate counter‑pressure

Execution is **never automatic**. Even at 0 HP, the Dungeon requires the moment to *mean* something.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"They are open. You see it. Now show me what you think victory looks like."
```

---

# ⭐ **12.2 Primed — The Only Execution Trigger**

A target becomes **Primed** when they meet any *Primed Condition*. These conditions are modular and may expand later.

### **Current Primed Conditions (Core Set):**

- The target has **3 Vulnerable**
- The target is at **≤ 25% HP**
- The target suffers **Stagger 2**
- A Path ability explicitly says it **Primes** the target

If any of these apply → the target receives the **Primed** condition.

Primed does *not* guarantee success—it merely gives you permission.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
"Exposure is a gift. Waste it, and you bore me."
```

---

# ⭐ **12.3 Declaring an Execution**

Execution is declared **before** rolling dice and replaces the next attack in your declared chain.

### **Requirements to Declare:**

- The target is **Primed**
- You have **1 RP** available
- You have an attack action slot coming up in the chain

### **When You Declare Execution:**

- Replace your next action with **Execution Strike**
- Heat is immediately set to **0**
- Balance penalty for the action is automatically **–2** (heavy commitment)

Execution is a commitment of intent.

---

# ⭐ **12.4 Execution — A3 Contest Variant**

Execution uses the A3 Contest Model with higher stakes.

```
EXECUTION ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Offensive Mods + Positive Balance – Negative Balance

EXECUTION DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational bonuses
```

### **Outcomes:**

#### ✔ **Success (AV ≥ DV):**

- The target is killed **if they are at 0 HP or Primed**
- If they had HP remaining, Execution deals **critical finishing damage** (GM discretion: usually 6–10)
- Gain **1 Blood Mark**
- Gain **+1 RP**
- Entertainment Rating increases

#### ✔ **Failure (DV > AV):**

- Execution **does not occur**
- Your chain ends immediately
- You suffer **Stagger 1**
- Lose **all Momentum**
- The enemy gains **+1 Positive Balance**

#### ✔ **Catastrophic Failure (DV ≥ AV + 10):**

- All above penalties apply, plus:
- You take **critical damage** (GM fiat: 1d6–1d10)
- The Dungeon mocks you

```
[DUNGEON LAUGHTER]
"Ah… delicious failure. Try again. If you live."
```

---

# ⭐ **12.5 Blood Marks — The Dungeon’s Approval**

Blood Marks represent how deeply you have impressed—or tempted—the Dungeon. They rise when you:

- Perform Executions
- Impress the Dungeon with rhythm mastery
- Kill elite foes stylishly

### **Blood Mark Effects (Default Table):**

| Blood Marks | Player Benefit                 | Dungeon Reaction            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **1**       | +1 damage vs Wounded foes      | Whispering begins           |
| **2**       | +1 Momentum on Perfect Defense | Enemies react aggressively  |
| **3**       | +1 Resolve Action slot         | Hunter awareness begins     |
| **4**       | Execution range widens         | Environment becomes hostile |
| **5**       | Ascend or Fall                 | Hunter stalks constantly    |

Blood Marks rarely decrease.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
"Power stains. Let it." 
```

---

# ⭐ **12.6 Cleansing Blood Marks**

Only rare actions or places can remove Blood Marks:

- Shrine purification
- Veinscore sacrifice
- NPC contracts
- Consuming boss‑hearts

Cleansing is always costly.

---

# ⭐ **12.7 Execution Example**

**Scenario:**
An enemy has 3 Vulnerable → They become **Primed**.

You declare Execution as your next action.

Your AV: 18 (roll + mods)
Enemy DV: 14

You succeed.

Result:

- Enemy dies
- Gain **1 Blood Mark**
- Gain **+1 RP**
- Heat resets to 0
- Dungeon voice whispers approval

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
"A clean end. A beautiful moment. Feed the stone with more."

# ⭐ END OF SECTION 12 — READY FOR SECTION 13

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 13 — FIGHTING A MOB (Multi‑Enemy Rhythm Combat)**

(*This section already inserted — retained for context*)

---

# 🩸 **SECTION 13 — FIGHTING A MOB (Multi‑Enemy Rhythm Combat)**

*“One opponent teaches you rhythm. Many opponents teach you humility.” —The Dungeon*

Combat in Veinbreaker is designed for **1v1 as the core experience**, but the Dungeon *loves* to throw multiple enemies at a Veinbreaker to test their rhythm under chaos.

Mob fights follow the same core rules, with additional layering that increases tension, complexity, and entertainment.

This system preserves:

- **Chain Declaration integrity**
- **Balance / Heat / Momentum rhythms**
- **Single‑roll A3 contests**
- **Resolve Action timing windows**

…and adds new tactical pressure without requiring a grid or positioning map.

---

# ⭐ **13.1 One Chain. Many Threats.**

When facing multiple enemies:

### ✔ You declare **ONE chain**, not one per enemy.

### ✔ Each enemy gets **ONE Interrupt attempt per round**.

### ✔ Each enemy has its own **A3 contest** vs yours.

A 3‑enemy fight gives:

- 1 chain for you
- Up to 3 Interrupt attempts per action sequence

But never more than **one interrupt per enemy per round**.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"Your rhythm is one song. Their blades are the chorus."
```

---

# ⭐ **13.2 Threat Scaling — Overwhelm Pressure**

Each additional enemy increases the difficulty of defensive contests.

For each enemy beyond the first:

**+1 Difficulty to all your Defense Values vs Interrupts**

Two enemies → +1 penality
Three enemies → +2 penalities
Four enemies → +3 penalities

This does **not** modify your offensive AV — only your ability to maintain your chain safely.

```
[DUNGEON SMILE]
“Pressure reveals art.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.3 Targeting: Declare a Target Per Action**

When declaring your chain, you specify **which target each attack action hits**.

You may:

- Strike the same foe repeatedly
- Bounce attacks across multiple foes
- Mix utility/movement actions freely

### Switching Targets Has a Price

Changing targets mid‑chain applies:

**–1 Balance**

---

# ⭐ **13.4 Interrupt Order — Who Strikes Back First?**

After each of your actions (except the first), enemies attempt Interrupts in this order:

1. **Closest Threat**
2. **Context Trigger** enemies
3. **Remaining foes** (round‑robin)

Each enemy may Interrupt **only once per round**.

---

# ⭐ **13.5 Perfect Defense in Mob Combat**

Perfect Defense becomes even more powerful here.

### ✔ Gain +1 Positive Balance

### ✔ Gain +1 Momentum

### ✔ Redirect Perfect effects onto *any enemy engaged with you*

Examples:

- Perfect Parry → Riposte a *different* enemy
- Perfect Block → Gain Retaliate vs multiple attackers
- Perfect Ward → Radiance spreads to more foes

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“One perfect moment against many… exquisite.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.6 Heat in Mob Combat**

Heat is **global**, not per‑enemy.

Attacking different foes still builds Heat normally.

Switching targets applies **–1 Balance** (as above).

Heat Bursts damage only the **declared target**, unless an ability specifies otherwise.

---

# ⭐ **13.7 Multi‑Enemy Execution**

Execution affects the battlefield.

### When you Execute one enemy:

All other enemies suffer **one** of:

- Off‑Balance
- Vulnerable 1
- 1 damage
- –1 Momentum

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
“When one falls, the rest remember how small they are.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.8 Resolve Action — Split Intent**

A Resolve technique designed for multi‑enemy combat.

### **Split Intent — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 2 RP
**Cooldown:** 1 round
**Tag:** [Any Window]
**Effect:**
Your next attack in this chain targets **two enemies**.

- Roll **one** Attack Value
- Each enemy rolls their own DV
- Heat is gained **once**

---

# ⭐ **13.9 Swarm Units (Grouped Enemies)**

A swarm:

- Shares one HP pool
- Rolls DV once
- Deals damage as a unit
- Applies debuffs based on quantity

Hitting a swarm damages all members equally.

---

# ⭐ **13.10 Multi‑Enemy Rhythm Example**

You declare:

1. Pulse Strike → Enemy A
2. Movement → stabilize Balance
3. Heavy Attack → Enemy B

Enemies Interrupt in order as actions resolve.

Perfect Parry vs Enemy A → +1 Balance, Riposte Window.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENTARY]
“One against three… a familiar story. Usually shorter.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.11 Dungeon Philosophy — Why Mobs Matter**

Mob fights test:

- Your Balance control
- Your Heat management
- Your Momentum discipline
- Your ability to plan entire chains knowing multiple threats may strike

They reward Veinbreakers who:

- Use Perfect Defense well
- Use Resolve Actions intelligently
- Switch targets only with intent
- Preserve Rhythm in chaos

```
[DUNGEON FINAL WORD]
“Dance for me, Veinbreaker.
Let me see how you move when fear has many faces.”
```

# 🩸 **SECTION 14 — PARTY VS SINGLE ENEMY (Boss Rhythm Combat)**

> *“One rhythm against many is pressure. Many rhythms against one? That is a feast.” —The Dungeon*

Veinbreaker fully supports multiple players fighting one powerful enemy using the A3 + Dynamic Rhythm system. Only a few additional rules are required to keep boss fights tense, fair, and cinematic.

This section defines:

- Enemy **Interrupt Economy** in party fights
- Optional **Boss Interrupt Reserve** trait
- Optional **Threat Focus** system for turn‑order strategy
- Dungeon‑voice clarifications and examples

---

# ⭐ **14.1 Core Rule — One Interrupt Per Player Turn**

A single enemy (elite, champion, boss) receives:

### ✔ **ONE Interrupt attempt during each player's turn**

—not per action, not per round.

This keeps boss fights:

- Dangerous but not overwhelming
- Predictable enough for planning
- Consistent with multi‑enemy rhythm logic

### Example:

- Player A takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
- Player B takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
- Player C takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“One foe. Many dancers. Let me see who stumbles first.”
```

---

# ⭐ **14.2 Boss Action Economy (Enemy Rhythm Model)**

Bosses inherently act **between player turns**.

### Standard Boss Round:

1. Player A turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
2. Player B turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
3. Player C turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
4. **Boss Turn** → Acts normally.

This creates continuous pressure while still giving players room for expression.

---

# ⭐ **14.3 Optional Boss Trait — Interrupt Reserve**

Some elite foes deserve *more teeth*.

### **Interrupt Reserve (X)**

A boss with Interrupt Reserve **may attempt X Interrupts per player turn**, but:

- They must be triggered by different actions
- They cannot fire multiple Interrupts on the *same* action resolution
- They cannot exceed **one Interrupt per action**, ever

### Example:

Boss has **Interrupt Reserve 2**.

- Player A begins a 4‑action chain
- Boss Interrupts on Action 2
- Boss Interrupts again on Action 4

```
[DUNGEON THRILL]
“Oh, you thought I was done hitting back?”
```

This trait should be reserved for:

- Bosses
- Named elites
- Aberrant Hunters

---

# ⭐ **14.4 Optional System — Threat Focus (Recommended for Boss Fights)**

Turn order matters. Aggression order matters more.

### **Threat Focus (Boss Passive)**

As more players strike the boss in the same round, the boss becomes increasingly wary—and harder to hit.

### **Threat Focus Table**

| Attacker Position This Round | Boss DV Modifier |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **1st attacker**             | +0               |
| **2nd attacker**             | +1               |
| **3rd attacker**             | +2               |
| **4th attacker**             | +3               |

- Applies only to **Attack Actions**
- Resets at the start of the round
- Does not affect Reactions or Resolve Actions

### Why It Works

- Encourages creative turn sequencing
- Prevents "4 players Nova at once" trivialization
- Makes earlier attacks safer but less damaging
- Makes late‑round attacks riskier but potentially Heat‑boosted

```
[DUNGEON CHUCKLE]
“Take turns. Take risks. Take consequences.”
```

---

# ⭐ **14.5 Execution in Party Combat**

When multiple players focus one target:

- Only the player declaring **Execution** interacts with the Primed condition.
- Execution effects (Off‑Balance, Vulnerable on nearby foes) apply normally.

Players may set up each other via:

- Vulnerable stacking
- Stagger stacking
- Heat softening
- Perfect Defense momentum shifts

Execution remains a **singular moment of intent**, not a group action.

---

# ⭐ **14.6 Balance, Heat & Momentum Across Multiple Players**

Players’ Rhythm stats remain **independent**:

- Each player has their own Balance
- Each has their own Heat
- Each has their own Momentum
- Boss resets its Momentum each turn like any enemy

The multi‑player dynamic emerges through:

- Sequencing
- Coordinated debuffs
- Forcing Interrupts on less valuable chains

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“Together you are stronger… but also more predictable.”
```

---

# ⭐ **14.7 Example — Three Players vs a Tier‑2 Boss**

**Turn Structure:**

- **Player 1** attacks first → Boss Interrupt chance low.
- **Player 2** builds Heat → Boss DV +1 (Threat Focus).
- **Player 3** attempts a heavy finisher → Boss DV +2.

Boss uses **Interrupt Reserve 2**:

- Interrupts Player 2’s second action
- Interrupts Player 3’s first action

Players coordinate to:

- Stack Stagger via Martial
- Apply Bleed via Shadow
- Store Radiance via Faith

Player 3 executes a Heat Burst finisher → **Primed condition hit**.

```
[DUNGEON EXCITEMENT]
“Yes… yes… make it hurt.”
```

---

# 

# 🩸 **SECTION 15 — OPTIONAL SYSTEMS (Advanced Rhythm Enhancements)**

These systems are optional but recommended for tables seeking additional tactical depth without adding complexity. They integrate seamlessly with Dynamic Rhythm Combat.

They include:

- Threat Focus (already added to Section 14)
- Boss Interrupt Reserve (already added)
- Additional party‑wide Rhythm interactions
- Group Heat mechanics (experimental)

More additions can follow as we refine the system.

```
[DUNGEON FINAL REMARK]
