# Veinbreaker Combat Upkeep Checklist (GM One-Pager)

## Start of Each Round
- Lock turn order unless an effect changes it; note who holds momentum/aggro priority.
- Resolve end-of-round timers: hazards, lair actions, arena phase clocks, reinforcements.
- Advance any global clocks (tremor/hunter, contract timers, scene limits) if they tick per round.

## Start of Each Creature's Turn
- Rhythm reset: Balance → 0 (unless off-balance/debuff), Heat → 0 (unless stabilized), Momentum → 0.
- Resolve: refresh 2 RP up to cap (Tier 0 cap 5); carryover stays if under cap.
- Pools: refresh any per-round path pools (Martial/Shadow/Magic/Faith) per rules.
- Apply start-of-turn effects: damage/heal ticks (Bleed/Poison/etc.), stances, buffs/debuffs, off-balance, slowed/immobilized.
- Cooldowns/timers: tick down ability/item cooldowns; fire any “start of turn” triggers.
- Environment start effects: hazards that pulse on turn start, zone shifts, line-of-sight changes.

## During Acting Turn (Attacker)
- Declare full chain up front; pay RP for all actions; state targets.
- Track Balance per action (typical: light −1, heavy −2; movement may restore if listed).
- Track Heat on hits; apply thresholds; choose Burst/Purge/Stabilize between actions.
- Spend path pools and mark cooldowns when abilities fire.
- Apply status effects (Bleed, Stagger, Vulnerable, Guard Break, etc.) as actions hit.
- If executing a Primed target, swap next action for Execute; apply heavy Balance penalty and reset Heat.
- If defender lands damage via interrupt, attacker’s chain ends immediately (momentum may flip).

## During Defending Turn (Reactive)
- Interrupt windows: Dodge/Parry/Block/Redirect/Ward cost 1 RP; roll DV contests.
- On success, adjust Momentum; Perfect Defense grants +1 positive Balance and any riposte/retaliate windows per tag.
- Track DV mods: Momentum, IDF, cover/position, situational bonuses/penalties.

## End of Turn
- Resolve end-of-turn effects: damage/heal ticks, fading buffs, stance drops, summoned durations.
- Drop “until end of turn” bonuses/penalties.
- Confirm RP carried over (cannot exceed cap); pools as rules state.
- Note who ends with momentum/aggro priority for next round if you use that variant.
- Apply arena/hazard end-of-turn pulses if present.

## Ongoing During Combat
- Advance per-round/turn timers: ability cooldowns, contracts, tremor/hunter clocks, reinforcement waves.
- Track Blood Marks gained on Executes; apply GM-facing consequences when thresholds hit.
- Watch for player pattern triggers to switch/adjust enemy AI archetype behaviors.
