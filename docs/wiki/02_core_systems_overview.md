# 🩸 **SECTION 2 — CORE SYSTEMS OVERVIEW**

Veinbreaker’s combat is built on three interlocking flows:

## **1. BALANCE — Your Offensive Rhythm**

Balance measures how stable, centered, or overextended you are during a chain. It changes with each declared action.

### **Balance States**

- **Positive Balance (+1 to +3)**: Perfect form, precise footwork, tactical control.\
  *Gained from Perfect Defense or Balance Surge.*
- **Neutral (0)**: Centered stance; no bonuses or penalties.
- **Negative (–1 to –10)**: Overextension from attacks, abilities, and heavy actions.

### **Effects of Balance**

Balance modifies your **Attack Value (AV)**:

- Positive Balance **adds** to Attack Value.
- Negative Balance **subtracts** from Attack Value.

Every action after your first affects balance.
Typical action costs are light attack −1 Balance, heavy −2  
A movment action will help you regain 2 balance

Balance resets to **0 at the start of your turn** unless a debuff prevents it.

“Your rhythm changes… I smell intent.”

## **2. HEAT — Your Aggressive Flow**

Heat rises when attacks hit.\
Heat resets when your chain ends.

### **Heat Thresholds**

- **Heat 1:** No bonus
- **Heat 2:** +1 damage
- **Heat 3:** +2 damage
- **Heat 4:** +3 damage, increased Execution pressure
- **Heat 5:** +4 damage, high Interrupt risk

### **Heat Spend**

Heat can be spent **between actions in a chain**.

**Heat Burst:** Spend all Heat → add **Heat × 2** bonus damage.\
**Heat Purge:** Spend all Heat → Balance resets to **0** (chain continues).\
**Heat Stabilize:** At Heat 3+ → preserve up to **2 Heat** into next turn.

```
[DUNGEON THRILL: Heat Rising]
“Push harder. I want to see you burn.”

## **3. MOMENTUM — Your Defensive Rhythm**

Momentum rises when you successfully Dodge, Parry, or Block. It fuels **Perfect Defense**, allowing:

- Perfect Dodge
- Perfect Parry
- Perfect Block

**Perfect Defense → +1 Positive Balance**

Momentum resets at the start of your turn.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“You move well when survival matters.”
```

## **4. RESOLVE — Your Action Currency**

Resolve (RP) is spent to declare actions in a chain. Every action costs **1 RP**, minimum.

You gain RP when you:

- Hit an enemy
- Perfect Defend
- Execute
- Impress the Dungeon (rare bonuses)

Resolve refreshes **2 RP at the start of your turn**, up to your Resolve cap (Tier 0 cap: **5**). Unspent RP carries over between turns; you cannot exceed your cap.

---

## **5. ATTACK VALUE (AV) & DEFENSE VALUE (DV)**

Veinbreaker uses the **A3 Contest System**:

### **ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Bonuses – Balance Penalty + Positive Balance**

### **DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers**

Attack Value vs Defense Value determines hit or miss.

Margin ≥ 5 → **Perfect Defense or Perfect Block** triggers special effects.

---

## **6. CHAIN DECLARATION (Core Rule)**

Before rolling, you must declare your full chain:

- The number of actions
- The type of each action
- RP is spent **now**, not later

Chains reflect rhythm, risk, and foresight.

You cannot change an action mid-chain unless an item, boon, or ability explicitly allows it.

```

Final Agreed Meanings (Authoritative)
Momentum — Encounter-scale pressure

What it is: Control of the fight over time.

Scope: Persists for the entire encounter.

Cap: 8 (for now; explicitly a tuning knob).

Primary uses:

Adds to Defense (DV side) when defending.

Makes you harder to hit as the fight goes on.

How it changes:

On hit:

Links 1–2: +1

Link ≥3: +2

On miss: −1

On interrupt suffered: Momentum is halved (round down).

Why:
Creates a rising tension curve and makes interrupts matter without initiative.

Balance — Chain-local execution stability

What it is: How steady you are right now while executing a chain.

Scope: Per-chain only; resets when the chain ends.

Primary uses:

Adds to the attack roll of the aggressor.

Reduces interrupt vulnerability (high balance = harder to interrupt).

How it changes:

On hit: +1 (early), scales with deeper chains.

On miss: −1

On interrupt: irrelevant after (chain always ends).

Why:
Balance rewards clean execution and punishes sloppy chains without long-term punishment.

Heat — Spendable overcommitment power

What it is: Voluntary excess force. Power you choose to burn.

Scope: Persists across chains; spendable.

Primary uses:

Can be spent to add damage or effects.

Enables late-game spikes and spectacle.

Consequences of high Heat:

Invites more interrupt windows.

Increases punishment severity when interrupted.

Important clarification we locked in:

Heat is not “pushing too far” or loss of control.

Heat is “I’m awesome and daring you to answer.”

Why:
Heat creates chosen risk, not passive danger.
