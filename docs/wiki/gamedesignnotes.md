## Designer’s Note — Why Interrupts Are Capped

Interrupts in Veinbreaker are intentionally limited to **one attempt per defender per round**.

This is not a balance convenience.  
It is a **structural constraint** that preserves the identity of the system.

---

### Interrupts Are Meant to Be Decisive, Not Incremental

An Interrupt represents a defender successfully exploiting a moment of exposure severe enough to **land a real hit**.

In Veinbreaker:
- Misses create risk
- Exposure creates opportunity
- **Damage ends the chain**

Allowing multiple Interrupt attempts would transform Interrupts from a decisive failure condition into a repeatable resource exchange. That would undermine their role as a clear, legible breaking point in the rhythm of combat.

Interrupts are meant to feel like a trap snapping shut — not a sequence of defensive actions.

---

### Scarcity Creates Tension and Meaningful Choice

Because Interrupts are capped, defenders must choose *when* to strike.

This forces:
- timing discipline,
- pattern recognition,
- and deliberate punishment of greed.

If Interrupts could be attempted repeatedly, the correct play would often become “Interrupt as often as possible,” which collapses choice into optimization and reduces tension.

Scarcity ensures that when an Interrupt happens, it matters.

### Resolve Is a Planning Currency, Not a Reaction Pool

Resolve Points exist to constrain **declared intent**, not to fuel reactive safety.

Capping Interrupts prevents Resolve from becoming a general-purpose defense economy. Players must commit to plans without knowing they can always buy their way out after exposure is revealed.

This preserves Veinbreaker’s core requirement:
> Intent must be declared before safety is known.

---

### Chains Must Remain Viable but Dangerous

The combat system assumes that long chains are:
- attractive,
- risky,
- and occasionally rewarded.

Unlimited Interrupts would mathematically discourage chaining at all, forcing conservative play and reducing the expressive range of the system.

The cap ensures that chains are viable, but never safe.

---

### Defense Should Stabilize Rhythm, Not Dominate It

Veinbreaker already provides multiple defensive tools:
- Perfect Defense
- Momentum
- Movement
- Resolve Actions

Interrupts are not meant to replace these. They are a **pressure valve**, not a control mechanism.

Capping Interrupts prevents defense from becoming the dominant strategy and preserves aggression as a meaningful, tempting choice.

---

### Summary

Interrupts are capped because they must remain:
- rare,
- decisive,
- legible,
- and frightening.

Removing or loosening this cap would:
- reduce tension,
- encourage defensive optimization,
- blur failure conditions,
- and erode the rhythm-based identity of the system.

Veinbreaker is not about preventing harm at all costs.  
It is about choosing **when risk is worth showing**.

The Interrupt cap enforces that choice.
