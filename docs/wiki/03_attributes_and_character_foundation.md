# 🩸 SECTION 3 — ATTRIBUTES & CHARACTER FOUNDATION (4‑Stat System)

In Veinbreaker, attributes determine how hard you hit, how long you last, and how fluidly you maintain **Rhythm**—the interplay of **Balance, Heat, and Momentum**.

Attributes do **not** determine accuracy; the **A3 Contest Model** handles that. Instead, attributes shape:

- Damage
- HP
- Ability Pool sizes
- Rhythm interaction (Balance / Heat / Momentum)

```
[DUNGEON UI]
“Four numbers. Endless ways to impress… or disappoint me.”

## 3.1 The Four Attributes

All attributes begin at **8** before spending Veinscore.

### 🟥 POWER (POW)

Raw striking force, leverage, and physical presence.

- Determines **Power weapon damage**
- Fuels **Martial Pool**
- Adds weight to Balance shifts (heavy attacks)

### 🟪 AGILITY (AGI)

Speed, finesse, evasive flow.

- Determines **Finesse weapon damage**
- Fuels **Shadow Pool**
- Enhances Momentum gains through evasive defense

### 🧠 MIND (MND)

Arcane perception, pattern shaping, and current control.

- Determines **Magic ability damage**
- Fuels **Magic Pool**
- Helps stabilize or amplify Heat during spellchains

### ✨ SPIRIT (SPR)

Faith, conviction, radiant will.

- Determines **Faith ability damage**
- Fuels **Faith Pool**
- Influences Radiance, healing, and sanctity techniques

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Power shapes blows. Agility shapes moments. Mind shapes currents. Spirit shapes miracles.”
```

---

## 3.2 Attribute → Pool Conversion

Each Path maps directly to one Attribute.

- **Martial Pool = POW ÷ 2**
- **Shadow Pool = AGI ÷ 2**
- **Magic Pool = MND ÷ 2**
- **Faith Pool = SPR ÷ 2**

Pools regenerate each round unless suppressed.

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
“Your energies refill. What you do with them… entertains me.”
```

## 3.3 HP Formula (Updated)

Veinbreaker rewards bold fighters, not passive tanks.

```
HP = 10 + POW
```

- POW 8  → HP 18
- POW 12 → HP 22
- POW 14 → HP 24

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Health is not protection. Rhythm is protection.”
```

---

## 3.4 Attributes & Dynamic Rhythm

Attributes influence Rhythm indirectly.

### **Balance (Offensive Rhythm)**

- High AGI → faster Balance corrections
- High POW → deeper Balance penalties on heavy actions
- High MND → access to arcane Balance stabilizers

### **Heat (Aggressive Rhythm)**

- High MND → stable high‑Heat spellcasting
- High POW → more explosive Heat Bursts
- High SPR → Heat converted into Radiance options

### **Momentum (Defensive Rhythm)**

- High AGI → more Perfect Dodges
- High SPR → improved Perfect Parries
- High POW → stronger Blocks

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“When your stats align with your rhythm… I am pleased.”
```

## 3.5 Recommended Archetypes

Not mandatory—just thematic.

### **Stonepulse Martial**

POW 10–14, AGI 8–12

### **Hemocratic Shadow**

AGI 10–14, MND 8–12
