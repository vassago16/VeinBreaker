# Veinbreaker: System Analysis & Design Rationale

## 1) System Classification
Veinbreaker is a procedural action-RPG tabletop system built around declarative action sequencing, dynamic risk accumulation, and irreversible narrative consequence. It fits momentum-based combat, risk–reward escalation, and persistent-consequence RPGs. It is a tempo-control system: power is expressed by managing exposure under pressure, not by static turn-economy optimization.

## 2) Core Design Goal
Reward mastery of rhythm and intent rather than static optimization, while ensuring power always increases existential risk. Achieved by separating accuracy from damage scaling, tying advancement to irreversible costs, and making failure additive (not nullifying).

## 3) Structural Overview
Four interlocking layers:
- **Action Declaration:** How players commit to intent.
- **Rhythm:** How actions alter exposure and opportunity.
- **Interruption:** How the system punishes greed and predictability.
- **Persistence:** How consequences accumulate across sessions.

## 4) Action Declaration Layer
- **Chain Declaration:** Declare full chains up front; pay Resolve upfront; enforces foresight and visible risk commitment.
- **Resolve as Tempo:** Partial, capped regen; limits expression per window; carryover rewards restraint; prevents hoarding and full resets.

## 5) Rhythm Layer: Balance, Heat, Momentum
- **Balance (Offensive Exposure):** Overextension that resets at defined points; modifies AV; discourages long linear chains; models risk accumulation.
- **Heat (Aggression Escalation):** Builds damage, adds instability; can be spent to stabilize or burst; rewards success but tempts exposure.
- **Momentum (Defensive Flow):** Earned via defense; boosts DV and Perfect Defense; makes defense active and risk-engaging.
- Loop: aggression → exposure; defense → stability; success → escalation temptation.

## 6) Interruption Layer
- **Interrupts:** Punish predictability and long chains; create counterplay without random negation. Misses create vulnerability; failure occurs when exposure crosses thresholds.
- **Enemy AI as Behavior:** Archetypes over stats; variety without bloat; pattern recognition; rhythm-aware behaviors.

## 7) Persistence Layer: Blood Marks, Veinscore, Duns
- **Veinscore:** Advancement currency; lost on death if unspent; increases prey value; enforces spend-or-risk tension.
 - **Blood Marks:** Attention metric; grant power, drive corruption, trigger escalation; visibility score, not morality.
- **Dun (Death):** Death adds risk instead of resetting; Duns add to Blood Marks with no benefit; failure advances state.

## 8) Hunter as Systemic Regulator
Meta-pressure that caps escalation, forces phase transitions, and prevents farming; operates outside normal combat rules as a pressure function.

## 9) Why It Works
- Power raises risk; advancement hardens the game.
- Failure is meaningful but non-terminal; death alters trajectory.
- Mastery is rhythmic and transferable, not statistical.
- Systems are legible; resources have inverse pressure; no mechanic is isolated.

## 10) Tradeoffs & Constraints
Favors experienced, pattern-aware play; hostile to passive or conservative styles; resists min-maxing via irreversible consequences; trades resolution speed for decision depth—deliberate to meet the core goal.

## 11) Summary
Veinbreaker is about being seen. It measures intent, escalates consequence, and keeps survival non-neutral. It asks not if you win, but how much you reveal to keep going—a controlled study in risk, attention, and escalation.
