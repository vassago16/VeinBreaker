# 🩸 **SECTION 10 — EQUIPMENT, ITEMS & BOONS (Dungeon-Bound Armory)**

Equipment in Veinbreaker does **not** define your stats—it defines your **options**, your **flow**, and your **relationship with the Dungeon itself**.

Weapons grant **permissions**.
Armor grants **resilience cues**.
Items grant **moments**.
Boons grant **rules the Dungeon bends for you**.

```
[DUNGEON OPENING]
“Bring whatever tools you like. I will still enjoy breaking them… and you.”
```

# ⭐ **10.1 Equipment Philosophy — Less Math, More Rhythm**

Unlike traditional RPGs, Veinbreaker’s equipment avoids stat bloat.

Equipment affects:

- What **actions** you can perform (Parry, Block, Redirect…)
- How you interact with **Balance, Heat, and Momentum**
- What **status effects** you can inflict
- What **Reactions** you are allowed to use
- What **Resolve Actions** you can unlock or enhance

Equipment does *not* affect:

- Accuracy (A3 Contest handles that)
- Base damage (abilities handle that)
- Armor Class (does not exist)

Equipment shapes **style**, not math.

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
“A tool is interesting only when it tempts you to use it poorly.”
```

# ⭐ **10.2 Weapon Categories & Tags**

Weapons can have 1–2 tags. Tags determine what your combat flow *allows*.

| Category             | Examples                     | Tags                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Light Weapons**    | dagger, shortblade, stiletto | Slashing, Piercing, Finesse |
| **Medium Weapons**   | spear, mace, shortsword      | Slashing, Piercing, Blunt   |
| **Heavy Weapons**    | axe, warhammer, greatblade   | Heavy, Slashing, Blunt      |
| **Defensive Tools**  | shield, buckler              | Shield, Heavy               |
| **Magic Implements** | conduit rod, spell thread    | Magic Conduit               |
| **Faith Implements** | prayer vessel, chained relic | Faith Conduit               |

### Weapon tags grant permissions such as:

- **Finesse** → Parry, Riposte, Slip
- **Heavy** → Block, Guard Break, Stagger chance
- **Shield** → Perfect Block, Stability Actions
- **Magic Conduit** → Redirect, spell shaping
- **Faith Conduit** → Ward, Radiance abilities

Weapons do **not** dictate damage—they dictate *moments*.

# ⭐ **10.3 Armor & Defensive Gear**

Armor does not give AC. Instead, it interacts with Rhythm.

### **Light Armor**

- +1 to AGI‑based Movement contests
- Reduces Balance penalties from Movement by 1 (min 0)

### **Medium Armor**

- +1 to resisting **Stagger**
- +1 IDF vs Heavy Attacks

### **Heavy Armor**

- Stacks with Shields for **+1 Perfect Block Margin**
- +1 to resisting Bleed, but Movement has Disadvantage

Armor is always a tradeoff.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Weight changes your song. Sometimes beautifully… sometimes not.”

# ⭐ **10.4 Throwables & Consumables**

These are instant‑use items that modify Rhythm or inflict effects.

### **Flash Powder**

- Blind one enemy → They become **Distracted** and **Off‑Balance**.

### **Bloodglass Shard**

- Creates **Bleed 2** on hit.

### **Aether Coil**

- Spell next cast gets **Advantage** and **+2 damage**.

### **Radiant Ember**

- Gain **Radiance 1** and **Quickened**.

### **Stonepulse Balm**

- Remove **Stagger** and gain **+1 Balance**.

### **Resolve Draught**

- Gain **+2 RP immediately**.

Consumables are extremely powerful—because the Dungeon likes giving you choices that hurt later.

---

# ⭐ **10.5 Relics — Minor Dungeon Artifacts**

Relics alter Rhythm in specific, flavorful ways.

### Examples:

### **Heart‑Thread Band**

- When you gain Heat 3+, gain **+1 Momentum**.

### **Vein‑Etched Coin**

- 1/session: Reroll any Attack or Defense roll.

```
[DUNGEON LAUGHTER]
“Chance is delicious.”
```

### **Glass Suture Charm**

- When you inflict Bleed, inflict +1 Bleed on a second target.

### **Stonepulse Knot**

- While in any Stance → Balance penalties reduced by 1.

Relics serve as micro‑mutations to your Rhythm flow.

---

# ⭐ **10.6 Boons — Rule‑Level Gifts**

Boons come from:

- Achievements
- Boss kills
- Impressing the Dungeon
- Surviving a Hunter encounter

Boons change core rules for that character.

### Example Boons:

### **Boons of Flow**

- **Balance Floor** → Your Balance cannot drop below –3.
- **Heat Memory** → Preserve 2 Heat each turn (no roll needed).
- **Momentum Reservoir** → Momentum resets to 1 instead of 0.

### **Boons of Blood**

- **Hemocratic Echo** → When you cause Bleed, gain 1 Resolve.
- **Artery Sense** → Attacks vs Primed targets gain Advantage.

### **Boons of Radiance**

- **Canticle Halo** → Radiance never drops below 1.

### **Boons of the Dungeon** *(rare)*

- **Entertainment Engine** → When the table cheers or gasps, gain +1 RP.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“Rewarding you for amusing me is only fair.”
```

Boons are permanent and transformative.

---

# ⭐ **10.7 Crafting, Fusion & Path‑Bound Upgrades**

Crafting is rare and always thematic.

### **Stonepulse Fusion**

- Heavy weapons fuse with minerals → Stagger margin improves.

### **Hemocratic Grafting**

- Finesse weapons graft blood channels → Bleed stacks can exceed normal max.

### **Conduit Crystallization**

- Magic Conduits hold Heat without penalty.

### **Canticle Blessing**

- Faith Conduits store 1 Radiance between rests.

Crafting requires locations, rituals, or NPCs the Dungeon makes available.

---

# ⭐ **10.8 Inventory & the 10‑Second Rule**

Any item you hold for **10 consecutive seconds** becomes indexed in your extradimensional inventory.

- Inventory capacity: **Unlimited** (for now)
- **Weapon Swap requires a Resolve Action (1 RP)**
- Drawing non‑weapon items: **Free**
- Drawing a weapon: **Weapon Swap (1 RP)**
- Switching between two already‑indexed weapons: **Weapon Swap (1 RP)**
- The Dungeon may *remove* items if displeased

### **Weapon Swap — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 1 RP\
**Cooldown:** None\
**Tag:** [Any Window]\
**Effect:** Instantly equip a different indexed weapon.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Item Indexed… and oh? Changing weapons mid‑flow? Ambitious.”
```

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Item Indexed… for however long I allow it.”
```

---

# ⭐ **10.9 Equipment & Rhythm — Unified Flow**

Equipment should always:

- Present new tactical questions
- Open or close Rhythm options
- Change Reaction availability
- Modify how Heat, Balance, or Momentum behave

Equipment should **never**:

- Inflate numbers mindlessly
- Replace skill expression
- Overshadow Path abilities

Your weapon says *how* you fight.\
Your Path says *why*.\
Your Rhythm says *whether you live*.

```
[DUNGEON FINAL WORD]
“Use whatever tools you like…
The walls will still remember your blood.”
```
