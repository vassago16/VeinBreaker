# 🩸 **SECTION 14 — PARTY VS SINGLE ENEMY (Boss Rhythm Combat)**

> *“One rhythm against many is pressure. Many rhythms against one? That is a feast.” —The Dungeon*

Veinbreaker fully supports multiple players fighting one powerful enemy using the A3 + Dynamic Rhythm system. Only a few additional rules are required to keep boss fights tense, fair, and cinematic.

This section defines:

- Enemy **Interrupt Economy** in party fights
- Optional **Boss Interrupt Reserve** trait
- Optional **Threat Focus** system for turn‑order strategy
- Dungeon‑voice clarifications and examples

---

# ⭐ **14.1 Core Rule — One Interrupt Per Player Turn**

A single enemy (elite, champion, boss) receives:

### ✔ **ONE Interrupt attempt during each player's turn**

—not per action, not per round.

This keeps boss fights:

- Dangerous but not overwhelming
- Predictable enough for planning
- Consistent with multi‑enemy rhythm logic

### Example:

- Player A takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
- Player B takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
- Player C takes their turn → Boss may Interrupt once.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“One foe. Many dancers. Let me see who stumbles first.”
```

# ⭐ **14.2 Boss Action Economy (Enemy Rhythm Model)**

Bosses inherently act **between player turns**.

### Standard Boss Round:

1. Player A turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
2. Player B turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
3. Player C turn → Boss may Interrupt once.
4. **Boss Turn** → Acts normally.

This creates continuous pressure while still giving players room for expression.

---

# ⭐ **14.3 Optional Boss Trait — Interrupt Reserve**

Some elite foes deserve *more teeth*.

### **Interrupt Reserve (X)**

A boss with Interrupt Reserve **may attempt X Interrupts per player turn**, but:

- They must be triggered by different actions
- They cannot fire multiple Interrupts on the *same* action resolution
- They cannot exceed **one Interrupt per action**, ever

### Example:

Boss has **Interrupt Reserve 2**.

- Player A begins a 4‑action chain
- Boss Interrupts on Action 2
- Boss Interrupts again on Action 4

```
[DUNGEON THRILL]
“Oh, you thought I was done hitting back?”
```

This trait should be reserved for:

- Bosses
- Named elites
- Aberrant Hunters

---

# ⭐ **14.4 Optional System — Threat Focus (Recommended for Boss Fights)**

Turn order matters. Aggression order matters more.

### **Threat Focus (Boss Passive)**

As more players strike the boss in the same round, the boss becomes increasingly wary—and harder to hit.

### **Threat Focus Table**

| Attacker Position This Round | Boss DV Modifier |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **1st attacker**             | +0               |
| **2nd attacker**             | +1               |
| **3rd attacker**             | +2               |
| **4th attacker**             | +3               |

- Applies only to **Attack Actions**
- Resets at the start of the round
- Does not affect Reactions or Resolve Actions

### Why It Works

- Encourages creative turn sequencing
- Prevents "4 players Nova at once" trivialization
- Makes earlier attacks safer but less damaging
- Makes late‑round attacks riskier but potentially Heat‑boosted

```
[DUNGEON CHUCKLE]
“Take turns. Take risks. Take consequences.”
```

# ⭐ **14.5 Execution in Party Combat**

When multiple players focus one target:

- Only the player declaring **Execution** interacts with the Primed condition.
- Execution effects (Off‑Balance, Vulnerable on nearby foes) apply normally.

Players may set up each other via:

- Vulnerable stacking
- Stagger stacking
- Heat softening
- Perfect Defense momentum shifts

Execution remains a **singular moment of intent**, not a group action.

---

# ⭐ **14.6 Balance, Heat & Momentum Across Multiple Players**

Players’ Rhythm stats remain **independent**:

- Each player has their own Balance
- Each has their own Heat
- Each has their own Momentum
- Boss resets its Momentum each turn like any enemy

The multi‑player dynamic emerges through:

- Sequencing
- Coordinated debuffs
- Forcing Interrupts on less valuable chains

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“Together you are stronger… but also more predictable.”
```

---

# ⭐ **14.7 Example — Three Players vs a Tier‑2 Boss**

**Turn Structure:**

- **Player 1** attacks first → Boss Interrupt chance low.
- **Player 2** builds Heat → Boss DV +1 (Threat Focus).
- **Player 3** attempts a heavy finisher → Boss DV +2.

Boss uses **Interrupt Reserve 2**:

- Interrupts Player 2’s second action
- Interrupts Player 3’s first action

Players coordinate to:

- Stack Stagger via Martial
- Apply Bleed via Shadow
- Store Radiance via Faith

Player 3 executes a Heat Burst finisher → **Primed condition hit**.

```
[DUNGEON EXCITEMENT]
“Yes… yes… make it hurt.”
```
