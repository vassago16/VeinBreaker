# ☠️ Player Death & the Dun

> *“Death is not escape.  
It is the Dungeon remembering you.”*

In Veinbreaker, death does not end your story —  
but it **changes it permanently**.

---

## 🩸 What Happens When You Die

When your character is reduced to **0 HP** and cannot be saved:

- You **die**
- You **respawn at the last Safe Room** you used
- All current combat, chains, and effects end
- All **unspent Veinscore is lost**
- Your existing Blood Marks remain

Death always leaves a mark.

---

## ⚫ The Dun (Death Unmark)

When you respawn, you gain a **Dun**.

A **Dun** is a *faded, inert Blood Mark* — a scar of failure rather than triumph.

- A Dun grants **no bonuses**
- It cannot be spent, cleansed, or converted
- It is **permanent**
- It **adds +1 to your total Blood Marks**

> A Dun does nothing —  
> except make the Dungeon notice you more.

---

## 🧮 Blood Marks & Duns

Your **Total Blood Marks** are calculated as:

> **Blood Marks earned + Duns gained from death**

All systems that care about Blood Marks —  
corruption, danger, and the Hunter — use **Total Blood Marks**, not just earned ones.

Failure and brutality both draw attention.

---

## 👁 Why Duns Matter

Each Dun:

- Pushes you closer to **Hunter awareness**
- Accelerates corruption and escalation
- Makes future survival more dangerous

A careful fighter who dies and a ruthless executioner may reach the same fate —  
by different paths.

---

## 🕯 Safe Rooms After Death

After you gain a Dun:

- Safe Rooms provide **no bonus Resolve**
- No comfort or protection is guaranteed
- The Dungeon feels colder, quieter, smaller

Safe Rooms remember how often you return to them.

---

## 🚫 Death Is Not a Resource

Death cannot be farmed or exploited.

If players attempt to use death as a tactic:
- Danger escalates
- Protection erodes
- The Dungeon adapts

> *“You survive.  
That does not mean you are forgiven.”*

---

## 🩸 Design Intent (For Understanding)

- Death preserves continuity
- Punishment is **pressure**, not character deletion
- Duns make failure meaningful without ending play
- The Dungeon grows more dangerous — not you weaker

You may return from death.

The Dungeon never forgets that you did.
