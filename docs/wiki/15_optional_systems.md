# 🩸 **SECTION 15 — OPTIONAL SYSTEMS (Advanced Rhythm Enhancements)**

These systems are optional but recommended for tables seeking additional tactical depth without adding complexity. They integrate seamlessly with Dynamic Rhythm Combat.

They include:

- Threat Focus (already added to Section 14)
- Boss Interrupt Reserve (already added)
- Additional party‑wide Rhythm interactions
- Group Heat mechanics (experimental)

More additions can follow as we refine the system.
