# 🩸 **SECTION 12 — EXECUTION & BLOOD MARKS (Primed‑Only System)**

Execution is the Dungeon’s favorite moment—the instant when fear, fury, and rhythm collapse into a single killing intent. It is *not* automatic. It is *not* granted freely. It is a choice you make when the enemy is exposed, trembling, and **Primed**.

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
"A clean kill is boring. I want a *decisive* one."
```

# ⭐ **12.1 What Is Execution?**

Execution is a special finishing action a player may **declare** when—and only when—the target is **Primed**.

Execution:

- Costs **1 RP**
- Consumes **your next declared action slot**, replacing its attack
- Uses a special A3 Contest with higher risk and higher stakes
- On success → kills or catastrophically wounds the target
- On failure → exposes you to immediate counter‑pressure

Execution is **never automatic**. Even at 0 HP, the Dungeon requires the moment to *mean* something.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"They are open. You see it. Now show me what you think victory looks like."
```

---

# ⭐ **12.2 Primed — The Only Execution Trigger**

A target becomes **Primed** when they meet any *Primed Condition*. These conditions are modular and may expand later.

### **Current Primed Conditions (Core Set):**

- The target has **3 Vulnerable**
- The target is at **≤ 25% HP**
- The target suffers **Stagger 2**
- A Path ability explicitly says it **Primes** the target

If any of these apply → the target receives the **Primed** condition.

Primed does *not* guarantee success—it merely gives you permission.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
"Exposure is a gift. Waste it, and you bore me."
```

# ⭐ **12.3 Declaring an Execution**

Execution is declared **before** rolling dice and replaces the next attack in your declared chain.

### **Requirements to Declare:**

- The target is **Primed**
- You have **1 RP** available
- You have an attack action slot coming up in the chain

### **When You Declare Execution:**

- Replace your next action with **Execution Strike**
- Heat is immediately set to **0**
- Balance penalty for the action is automatically **–2** (heavy commitment)

Execution is a commitment of intent.

---

# ⭐ **12.4 Execution — A3 Contest Variant**

Execution uses the A3 Contest Model with higher stakes.

```
EXECUTION ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Offensive Mods + Positive Balance – Negative Balance

EXECUTION DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational bonuses
```

### **Outcomes:**

#### ✔ **Success (AV ≥ DV):**

- The target is killed **if they are at 0 HP or Primed**
- If they had HP remaining, Execution deals **critical finishing damage** (GM discretion: usually 6–10)
- Gain **1 Blood Mark**
- Gain **+1 RP**
- Entertainment Rating increases

#### ✔ **Failure (DV > AV):**

- Execution **does not occur**
- Your chain ends immediately
- You suffer **Stagger 1**
- Lose **all Momentum**
- The enemy gains **+1 Positive Balance**

#### ✔ **Catastrophic Failure (DV ≥ AV + 10):**

- All above penalties apply, plus:
- You take **critical damage** (GM fiat: 1d6–1d10)
- The Dungeon mocks you

```

"Ah… delicious failure. Try again. If you live."

# ⭐ **12.5 Blood Marks — The Dungeon’s Approval**

Blood Marks represent how deeply you have impressed—or tempted—the Dungeon. They rise when you:

- Perform Executions
- Impress the Dungeon with rhythm mastery
- Kill elite foes stylishly

### **Blood Mark Effects (Default Table):**

| Blood Marks | Player Benefit                 | Dungeon Reaction            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **1**       | +1 damage vs Wounded foes      | Whispering begins           |
| **2**       | +1 Momentum on Perfect Defense | Enemies react aggressively  |
| **3**       | +1 Resolve Action slot         | Hunter awareness begins     |
| **4**       | Execution range widens         | Environment becomes hostile |
| **5**       | Ascend or Fall                 | Hunter stalks constantly    |

Blood Marks rarely decrease.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
"Power stains. Let it."

# ⭐ **12.6 Cleansing Blood Marks**

Only rare actions or places can remove Blood Marks:

- Shrine purification
- Veinscore sacrifice
- NPC contracts
- Consuming boss‑hearts

Cleansing is always costly.

---

# ⭐ **12.7 Execution Example**

**Scenario:**
An enemy has 3 Vulnerable → They become **Primed**.

You declare Execution as your next action.

Your AV: 18 (roll + mods)
Enemy DV: 14

You succeed.

Result:

- Enemy dies
- Gain **1 Blood Mark**
- Gain **+1 RP**
- Heat resets to 0
- Dungeon voice whispers approval

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
"A clean end. A beautiful moment. Feed the stone with more."
