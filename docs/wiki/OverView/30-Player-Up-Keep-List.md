# Veinbreaker Player Upkeep Checklist

## Start of the Round
- Note turn order; know who acts before/after you.
- Check arena hazards or timers that pulse each round.

## Start of Your Turn
- Rhythm reset: Balance → 0 (unless off-balance), Heat → 0 (unless stabilized), Momentum → 0.
- Resolve: refresh 2 RP up to your cap (Tier 0 cap 5); keep any unspent RP under cap.
- Pools: refresh your per-round path pools (Martial/Shadow/Magic/Faith).
- Apply start-of-turn statuses: Bleed/Poison ticks, stance effects, buffs/debuffs, off-balance penalties.
- Tick cooldowns and any personal timers.

## During Your Chain (Attacking)
- Declare the full chain before rolling; pay RP upfront; name targets.
- Track Balance per action (typical: light −1, heavy −2); apply any movement Balance recovery your build allows.
- Track Heat on hits; apply threshold bonuses; decide on Burst/Purge/Stabilize between actions.
- Spend pools and mark ability cooldowns as used.
- Apply statuses you inflict (Bleed, Stagger, Vulnerable, Guard Break, etc.).
- If executing a Primed target, remember Execute swaps your next action, hits Balance hard, and resets Heat.
- If you take damage from a defender’s interrupt, your chain ends immediately.

## When Defending/Reacting
- Interrupt options cost 1 RP: Dodge/Parry/Block/Redirect/Ward. Roll DV contests as needed.
- On a Perfect Defense, gain +1 positive Balance and any riposte/retaliate window your gear/tag allows.
- Keep track of Momentum and DV bonuses (cover, position, situational mods).

## End of Your Turn
- Resolve end-of-turn effects: burn/bleed ticks, fading buffs, stance drops, summons duration.
- Drop “until end of turn” bonuses/penalties.
- Confirm remaining RP (cannot exceed cap) and note current Balance/Heat/Momentum reset expectations for next turn.
- Note if you ended with Momentum/aggro priority if your table uses that.

## Ongoing
- Track personal cooldowns, contract clocks, and any timers tied to your build.
- Track Blood Marks you gain on Executes; expect world/enemy reactions as thresholds rise.
