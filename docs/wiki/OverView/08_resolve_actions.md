# 🩸 **SECTION 8 — RESOLVE ACTIONS**

## 

Resolve Actions are a universal set of high‑tempo combat techniques available to all VeinBreakers. They are **not Path abilities** and **not chain actions**. Instead, they are used during the *resolution* of a declared chain to manipulate Rhythm, positioning, or timing.

Resolve Actions cost **Resolve (RP)**, may have **cooldowns**, and each specifies a **timing window** where it may be used.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"Resolve is rhythm. What you do with it… is entertainment."
```

## **8.1 What Is a Resolve Action?**

A Resolve Action is:

- Performed **between actions** of your declared chain
- Costs **Resolve (RP)** only (no Pool)
- Has **cooldowns**
- Uses **timing tags** (Attack Window, Defense Window, Any Window)
- Does **not** increase Balance penalty
- Does **not** replace your declared chain

They modify the *context* of a chain, not the chain itself.

## **8.2 Resolve Action Timing Windows**

Each Resolve Action specifies when it can be used:

- **[Attack Window]** — Immediately after an attack resolves.
- **[Defense Window]** — When you are hit or threatened.
- **[Any Window]** — Between any two declared actions.
- **[End‑of‑Chain]** — After your final declared action resolves.

## **8.4 How Resolve Actions Interact With Rhythm**

Resolve Actions allow real‑time modulation of Rhythm:

- **Balance Control** → Balance Surge (or Heat Purge synergy)
- **Heat Synergy** → Greed Burst before Heat Burst
- **Momentum Boosts** → Momentum Anchor before dangerous Interrupt windows
- **Chain Survival** → Disengage avoids lethal follow‑ups

They offer tactical flexibility without removing consequences of the Chain Declaration model.

---

## **8.5 Cooldowns & Limits**

Resolve Actions typically:

- Have **short cooldowns** (1–2 rounds)
- Cannot be spammed
- Are designed as *tempo tools*, not replacements for Abilities

Cooldowns reset at the start of your turn unless stated otherwise.

---

## **8.6 Expanding Resolve Actions (Tiers, Loot, Gifts)**

Resolve Actions may be unlocked or discovered through:

- Dungeon gifts
- Achievements
- Tier advancement
- Boss rewards
- Strange merchants

Higher‑tier Resolve Actions will offer more advanced timing manipulations.
