# Quick Start: Character Creation

Fast, table-ready character build in six steps.

## 1) Attributes
- Start at 8/8/8/8 (POW/AGI/MND/SPR); spend 18 Veinscore, max 14.
- Pick a spread that matches how you plan to fight (Power vs finesse vs focus vs faith).

## 2) Derived Stats
- HP = 10 + POWER.
- Pools (round down): Martial = POW/2, Shadow = AGI/2, Magic = MND/2, Faith = SPR/2.
- Resolve (RP): Max 5 at Tier 0; refresh 2 RP at start of your turn, carry over up to cap.
- IDF starts at 0 unless gear/buffs say otherwise.

## 3) Path Orientation
- Choose a combat identity (not a class): Martial, Shadow, Magic, or Faith. This guides your Tier 0 picks and flavor.

## 4) Tier 0 Abilities (Pick Four)
- 1 Attack, 1 Reaction (Dodge/Parry/Block/Redirect/Ward/etc.), 1 Utility, 1 Movement.
- Tier 0 costs: 0 Pool, 1 RP when used. Movement matters for Balance control.

## 5) Gear & Inventory
- Start with 1 melee OR 1 ranged weapon, light armor (flavor), and one personal item.
- Anything held for 10 seconds is indexed into your inventory fold.

## 6) Record & Ready
- Write attributes, HP, pools, Resolve cap, Momentum/IDF, your four Tier 0 abilities, and weapon choice.
- Confirm you know your Balance/Heat/Momentum resets and Resolve refresh (2 per turn to cap).

You’re built. Declare chains fast, manage Balance, and let Heat climb when it’s worth the risk.
