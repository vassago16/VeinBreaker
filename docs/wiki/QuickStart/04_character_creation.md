# 🩸 **SECTION 4 — CHARACTER CREATION (Dynamic Rhythm Edition)**

Character creation in Veinbreaker is about **choosing how you fight**—not who you were before the Dungeon took you. Your past is irrelevant here. Your *Rhythm*, your *Resolve*, and your *style* are what matter.

The Dungeon provides a framework. You provide intent.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Let us shape you into something interesting.”
```

---

## **4.1 Step 1 — Assign Your Attributes (POWER, AGILITY, MIND, SPIRIT)**

You begin with:

- **All four attributes at 8**
- **18 Veinscore (⟟)** to distribute

**Raising an attribute by +1 costs 1 Veinscore.**
No attribute may exceed **14** at character creation.

Example spread:

- POW 12
- AGI 10
- MND 8
- SPR 12

Your attributes determine:

- HP (via POWER)
- Pool sizes (each = attribute ÷ 2)
- Damage scaling for your chosen Path
- How your Rhythm interacts with combat

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Choose carefully. Your strengths will define your failures.”
```

---

## **4.2 Step 2 — Determine Derived Stats**

Derived stats calculate your survivability and combat readiness.

### **HP (Health Points)**

```
HP = 10 + POWER
```

### **Pools**

```
Martial Pool = POWER ÷ 2
Shadow Pool  = AGILITY ÷ 2
Magic Pool   = MIND ÷ 2
Faith Pool   = SPIRIT ÷ 2
```

(Rounded down)

Pools regenerate each round.

### **IDF (Interrupt Defense)**

Your resistance to being Interrupted.

IDF comes from:

- Momentum
- Buffs (Defense Up, Stances)
- Equipment (shields, wards)
- Abilities

Base IDF = **0** unless modified.

Used in:

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers
```

### **Resolve (RP)**

Resolve is your **tempo resource**, spent to declare actions in a chain.

### **Resolve Now Uses the Hybrid System**

- **Max Resolve = 5** at character creation
- **Resolve refreshes 2 RP at the start of your turn**, up to your Max Resolve
- You may carry unused Resolve from previous turns
- Resolve cannot exceed your **Max Resolve** (5 at Tier 0, increases with higher Tiers)

### **Sources of Bonus Resolve**

- Hitting an enemy: **+1 RP**
- Perfect Defense: **+1 RP**
- Execution: **+1 or more RP**
- Dungeon Favor: variable

### **Resolve Example**

Turn 1: You start with 5 RP, spend 4, end turn with 1 RP.
Turn 2: Regenerate 2 RP, start with 3 RP.
Turn 3: Regenerate 2 RP, start with 5 RP (cap).

```
[DUNGEON NOTE]
"Resolve is not a gift. It is a pulse. Let it build. Let it break."
```

## **4.3 Step 3 — Choose Your Path Orientation**

You do **not** choose a class—you choose a *combat identity*.

### **Martial (Power‑driven)**

Weapons, stances, force, Stonepulse.

### **Shadow (Agility‑driven)**

Bleed, precision, evasion, Hemocratic rites.

### **Magic (Mind‑driven)**

Currents, conduits, arcanum law.

### **Faith (Spirit‑driven)**

Radiance, blessings, miracles, Canticle.

Your starting Path does not lock you out of others, but shapes your Tier 0 picks.

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“Identity is not a prison. It is a starting stance.”
```

---

## **4.4 Step 4 — Choose Your Tier 0 Starting Abilities**

Every new Veinbreaker chooses **four Tier‑0 abilities**:

- **1 Attack**
- **1 Reaction** (Dodge, Parry, Block, Slip, Ward, etc.)
- **1 Utility** (Bless, Rhythm prep, minor support)
- **1 Movement Action** (Dash, Shift, Withdraw, Advance — coming in the Movement Action expansion)

Tier 0 abilities cost **0 Pool** but **1 RP** to declare as part of a chain.

You begin with:

- A simple attack
- A defensive maneuver
- A utility or supportive action
- A movement option to shape Balance and positioning

Tier 0 provides your **opening rhythm**, now including your first mobility tool — essential for Balance control and chain shaping.\*\*.

---

## **4.5 Step 5 — Inventory, Equipment & the Dungeon UI**

Your inventory exists in a dimensional fold. Anything you hold for **10 seconds** becomes indexed and stored.

Weapons have:

- Requirements (POW or AGI)
- Damage die
- Power type (Power/Finesse/Magic/Faith)

You may begin with:

- **One melee weapon** OR **one ranged option**
- Light armor (flavor only, no AC)
- A personal object from Earth (cosmetic)

```
[DUNGEON UI]
“Item Indexed.”
```

---

## **4.6 Step 6 — Finish Your Sheet**

Record:

- Attributes (POW, AGI, MND, SPR)
- HP
- Pools
- Resolve (RP)
- Derived Stats (Momentum, IDF)
- Tier 0 abilities
- Weapon choice

Your sheet should look clean, readable, and ready for rhythm‑driven combat.
