## SECTION 7 — REACTIONS (Dynamic Defense & Perfect Flow) (Dynamic Defense & Perfect Flow)\*\*

Reactions are **instant defensive techniques** used when an enemy targets you with an attack, spell, or threat. They do **not** cost an action slot in your declared chain, but they **do** require that you have an applicable Reaction ability that is **not on cooldown**.

Reactions shape **Momentum**, enable **Perfect Defense**, and determine whether you hold your rhythm—or lose it.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Reflex reveals truth. Let me see yours.”
```

---

## **7.1 What Is a Reaction?**

A **Reaction** is a defensive technique that may be used when you are directly threatened.

A Reaction:

- Costs **1 RP**
- Uses an **A3 Contest** (your DV vs enemy AV)
- Does **not** consume a chain action slot
- May only be used if the specific Reaction is **not on cooldown**
- Requires you to have the proper **weapon or conduit tag**
- Can only be used **once per incoming threat**

Reactions are the player’s real‑time adjustments within the Dungeon’s rhythm.

---

## **7.2 Reaction Windows**

You may React only inside specific timing windows.

### **Attack Window**

When you are targeted by a melee or ranged attack.

### **Spell Window**

When a magical attack or harmful arcane effect targets you.

### **Threat Window**

During an enemy **Interrupt** attempt.

### **Movement Window** *(rare)*

Some advanced techniques or magical manipulations may allow Reactions when an enemy moves.

Only **one Reaction** may be used per threat.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Timing. Everything here is timing.”
```

## **7.3 Reaction Types (Core 5)**

Below are the universal Reaction types available to Veinbreakers, each with its own requirements and rhythm effects.

---

## **7.4 Perfect Defense — Unified Rule**

A Perfect Defense occurs when:

```
DEFENSE VALUE ≥ ENEMY ATTACK VALUE + 5
```

Perfect Defense always grants:

- **+1 Positive Balance**
- **+1 Momentum** (in addition to the Reaction’s gain)
- The Reaction’s **Perfect Effect** (Riposte, Radiance, Redirect, etc.)

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“Perfection… briefly.”
```

---

## **7.5 Momentum & Reactions**

Momentum rises through successful defensive rhythm.

- Dodge → +1 Momentum
- Parry → +1 Momentum
- Block → +1 Momentum
- Ward/Redirect → +1 Momentum

Momentum increases your **Defense Value**:

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + bonuses
```

Momentum resets at the start of your turn.

Positive Momentum is essential for contesting Interrupts.

---

## **7.6 Reaction Failure States**

### **Fail (MoD 1–4)**

- Partial effect triggers (reduced dmg, partial dodge)
- Lose no Momentum

### **Heavy Fail (MoD 5–9)**

- Apply **Vulnerable 1** to yourself

### **Critical Fail (MoD 10+)**

## **7.7 Weapon & Conduit Requirements (Summary Table)**

| Reaction     | Requires                 | Cooldown |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |

---

## **7.8 Resolve Actions & Reactions (Interaction Rules)**

Resolve Actions may be used **during Reaction Windows**, but they do **not** replace Reactions.

Examples:

- **Rhythm Break** can cancel an Interrupt after a failed Parry.
- **Momentum Anchor** can raise DV before a Block roll.
- **Disengage** can end your chain before the Block resolves.
- **Balance Surge** can stabilize Balance after a Perfect Defense.

Resolve Actions modify the **flow around** Reactions—not the Reactions themselves.

---

## **7.9 Examples of Reaction Play**

### **Example A — Perfect Dodge**

Enemy AV = 15. Your DV = 21.

- You avoid all damage.
- Gain **Momentum +1**.
- Gain **Positive Balance +1**.

```
[DUNGEON CHUCKLE]
“Fast enough… this time.”
```

### **Example B — Parry → Riposte**

Enemy AV = 14. Your DV = 20.

- Perfect Parry achieved.
- Gain Momentum.
- Balance +1.
- Next attack gains a **Riposte Window**.

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Yes—punish that opening.”
```
