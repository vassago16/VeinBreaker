# 🩸 **SECTION 13 — FIGHTING A MOB (Multi‑Enemy Rhythm Combat)**

*“One opponent teaches you rhythm. Many opponents teach you humility.” —The Dungeon*

Combat in Veinbreaker is designed for **1v1 as the core experience**, but the Dungeon *loves* to throw multiple enemies at a Veinbreaker to test their rhythm under chaos.

Mob fights follow the same core rules, with additional layering that increases tension, complexity, and entertainment.

This system preserves:

- **Chain Declaration integrity**
- **Balance / Heat / Momentum rhythms**
- **Single‑roll A3 contests**
- **Resolve Action timing windows**

…and adds new tactical pressure without requiring a grid or positioning map.

---

# ⭐ **13.1 One Chain. Many Threats.**

When facing multiple enemies:

### ✔ You declare **ONE chain**, not one per enemy.

### ✔ Each enemy gets **ONE Interrupt attempt per round**.

### ✔ Each enemy has its own **A3 contest** vs yours.

A 3‑enemy fight gives:

- 1 chain for you
- Up to 3 Interrupt attempts per action sequence

But never more than **one interrupt per enemy per round**.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
"Your rhythm is one song. Their blades are the chorus."
```

---

# ⭐ **13.2 Threat Scaling — Overwhelm Pressure**

Each additional enemy increases the difficulty of defensive contests.

For each enemy beyond the first:

**+1 Difficulty to all your Defense Values vs Interrupts**

Two enemies → +1 penality
Three enemies → +2 penalities
Four enemies → +3 penalities

This does **not** modify your offensive AV — only your ability to maintain your chain safely.

```
[DUNGEON SMILE]
“Pressure reveals art.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.3 Targeting: Declare a Target Per Action**

When declaring your chain, you specify **which target each attack action hits**.

You may:

- Strike the same foe repeatedly
- Bounce attacks across multiple foes
- Mix utility/movement actions freely

### Switching Targets Has a Price

Changing targets mid‑chain applies:

**–1 Balance**

---

# ⭐ **13.4 Interrupt Order — Who Strikes Back First?**

After each of your actions (except the first), enemies attempt Interrupts in this order:

1. **Closest Threat**
2. **Context Trigger** enemies
3. **Remaining foes** (round‑robin)

Each enemy may Interrupt **only once per round**.

---

# ⭐ **13.5 Perfect Defense in Mob Combat**

Perfect Defense becomes even more powerful here.

### ✔ Gain +1 Positive Balance

### ✔ Gain +1 Momentum

### ✔ Redirect Perfect effects onto *any enemy engaged with you*

Examples:

- Perfect Parry → Riposte a *different* enemy
- Perfect Block → Gain Retaliate vs multiple attackers
- Perfect Ward → Radiance spreads to more foes

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“One perfect moment against many… exquisite.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.6 Heat in Mob Combat**

Heat is **global**, not per‑enemy.

Attacking different foes still builds Heat normally.

Switching targets applies **–1 Balance** (as above).

Heat Bursts damage only the **declared target**, unless an ability specifies otherwise.

---

# ⭐ **13.7 Multi‑Enemy Execution**

Execution affects the battlefield.

### When you Execute one enemy:

All other enemies suffer **one** of:

- Off‑Balance
- Vulnerable 1
- 1 damage
- –1 Momentum

```
[DUNGEON VOICE]
“When one falls, the rest remember how small they are.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.8 Resolve Action — Split Intent**

A Resolve technique designed for multi‑enemy combat.

### **Split Intent — Resolve Action**

**Cost:** 2 RP
**Cooldown:** 1 round
**Tag:** [Any Window]
**Effect:**
Your next attack in this chain targets **two enemies**.

- Roll **one** Attack Value
- Each enemy rolls their own DV
- Heat is gained **once**

---

# ⭐ **13.9 Swarm Units (Grouped Enemies)**

A swarm:

- Shares one HP pool
- Rolls DV once
- Deals damage as a unit
- Applies debuffs based on quantity

Hitting a swarm damages all members equally.

---

# ⭐ **13.10 Multi‑Enemy Rhythm Example**

You declare:

1. Pulse Strike → Enemy A
2. Movement → stabilize Balance
3. Heavy Attack → Enemy B

Enemies Interrupt in order as actions resolve.

Perfect Parry vs Enemy A → +1 Balance, Riposte Window.

```
[DUNGEON COMMENTARY]
“One against three… a familiar story. Usually shorter.”
```

---

# ⭐ **13.11 Dungeon Philosophy — Why Mobs Matter**

Mob fights test:

- Your Balance control
- Your Heat management
- Your Momentum discipline
- Your ability to plan entire chains knowing multiple threats may strike

They reward Veinbreakers who:

- Use Perfect Defense well
- Use Resolve Actions intelligently
- Switch targets only with intent
- Preserve Rhythm in chaos

```
[DUNGEON FINAL WORD]
“Dance for me, Veinbreaker.
Let me see how you move when fear has many faces.”
```
