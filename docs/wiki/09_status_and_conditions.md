# 🩸 **SECTION 9 — STATUS  & CONDITIONS **

Status effects in Veinbreaker fall into three categories:

- **Debuffs** — Harmful rhythms, imposed by enemies or your own missteps.
- **Buffs** — Empowering rhythms, gained intentionally or via Dungeon favor.
- **Rhythm Conditions** — Special states affecting Balance, Heat, or Momentum.

This section provides:

1. **Quick‑Reference Tables** (for fast use in combat)
2. **Expanded Writeups** (mechanical + Dungeon‑voice lore)
