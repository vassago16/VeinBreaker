# 🩸 **SECTION 6 — COMBAT FLOW (Dynamic Rhythm + A3 Model)**

Combat in Veinbreaker is not turn‑based in spirit—only in structure. Each turn represents a **sequence of rhythmic exchanges**, shaped by:

- **Balance** (your offensive rhythm),
- **Heat** (your aggressive escalation),
- **Momentum** (your defensive flow), and
- **Resolve** (your ability to act boldly).

This section explains how a turn unfolds from start to finish using the new **Dynamic Rhythm Combat** model.

```
[DUNGEON OPENING]

## **6.1 TURN START — RESET, REFRESH & RHYTHM CHECK**

At the start of your turn the start of your turn is when a chain is declared:

### ✔ **1. Resolve ****regenerates **2 RP** (up to your Max Resolve)**

Unless a buff, debuff, or stance modifies it.

### ✔ **2. Momentum resets to 0**

You must earn defensive flow again this round.

### ✔ **3. Balance resets to 0**

Unless a debuff (Stagger, Off‑Balance) or buff (Perfect Defense, stance) changes this.

### ✔ **4. Heat resets to 0**

Unless the previous round ended with **Heat Stabilize**, allowing you to carry **up to 2 Heat**.

### ✔ **5. Persistent effects update**

Bleed ticks, Radiance pulses, buffs/debuffs expire.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE]
“Fresh breath. Fresh fear. Begin.”
```

## **6.2 DECLARING A CHAIN (Core Rule)**

Before rolling any dice, the attacker must declare:

- **How many actions** they will take (minimum 1)
- **Which actions** they will perform
- **In what order**
- **RP is spent immediately** (1 RP per action)

This declaration represents *intention, rhythm, and greed.*

### ✔ **You cannot change your chain mid‑execution**

Unless an ability or boon explicitly allows it.

### ✔ **A chain cannot be declared if you do not have enough RP to pay for all actions.**

### ✔ **Movement actions** may appear anywhere in your chain.

Movement stabilizes Balance and shapes positioning.

```
[DUNGEON NOTICE: Chain Pattern Locked]
“Let us see if your body can keep up with your mouth.”
```

## **6.3 THE FIRST ACTION — THE A3 CONTEST BEGINS**

The first action in your chain establishes your **initial Attack Value (AV)**.

### ✔ Balance does **not** affect the first action.

Opening attack is always neutral unless modified by buffs/debuffs.

### **Attack Value Formula (Simplified)**

```
ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Offensive Modifiers + Balance Modifier
```

Where:

- **Balance Modifier** = +X (positive), –X (negative), or 0
- **Offensive Modifiers** come from abilities, Heat, weapon tags, position

### **Defense Value (DV)**

```
DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers
```

### **Margin of Difference (MoD)**

The difference between AV and DV determines the outcome.

#### ✔ If AV ≥ DV → **Hit**

#### ✔ If AV < DV → **Miss** (chain continues!)

#### ✔ If DV ≥ AV + 5 → **Perfect Defense**

- Defender gains **+1 Positive Balance**
- Some reactions can deal damage back

```
[DUNGEON DELIGHT]
“Ah… the first move. Always a lie or a promise.”
```

## **6.4 BALANCE SHIFT PER ACTION**

Each action in your declared chain modifies Balance.

### Typical Balance Costs:

| Action Type         | Balance Change                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Light Attack**    | –1                             |
| **Heavy Attack**    | –2                             |
| **Movement Action** | +1 (or halve negative Balance) |
| **Utility**         | 0 or varies                    |
| **Tier Abilities**  | –1 to –3 depending on power    |

### ✔ Balance can go *deep negative*.

The deeper the negative, the more reckless your rhythm.

### ✔ Positive Balance (from Perfect Defense) helps early attacks.

Positive Balance only applies **after** the first action.

[DUNGEON COMMENT]
“Overreach… yes. Now you’re interesting.”

## **6.5 HEAT GAIN & SPEND DURING CHAIN EXECUTION**

Heat grows as long as you keep hitting.

### **HEAT GAIN**

- Each successful attack → **+1 Heat**
- Crits or high Margin → **+2 Heat**

### **HEAT SPEND OPTIONS (Between Actions)**

You may spend accumulated Heat to shift rhythm.

#### **Heat Burst**

Spend all Heat → Add **Heat × 2** damage to next attack.

#### **Heat Purge**

Spend all Heat → Reset Balance to **0** without ending chain.

#### **Heat Stabilize**

If Heat ≥ 3 at chain end → Carry **up to 2 Heat** into next turn.

```
[DUNGEON THRILL]

## **6.6 MOMENTUM — THE DEFENSIVE FLOW**

Momentum rises only through defense.

### You gain Momentum when you:

- Successfully **Dodge** → +1 Momentum
- Successfully **Parry** → +1 Momentum
- Successfully **Block** → +1 Momentum

### **Perfect Defense → +1 Positive Balance**

Your stance sharpens.

Momentum affects **Defense Value**, making Interrupts harder.

```
[DUNGEON OBSERVATION]
“You defend best when it matters most.”
```

---

## **6.7 INTERRUPTS — WHEN THE DUNGEON PUNISHES GREED**

After each action in a chain (except the first), the **enemy may attempt an Interrupt**.

Interrupts represent moments where your Balance, Heat, or greed exposes you.

### **Interrupt Contest**

```
ENEMY ATTACK VALUE vs YOUR DEFENSE VALUE
```

If enemy wins by:

- **0–4** → Chain continues (unless you take damage)
- **5+** → **Chain breaks immediately**
- **10+** → **Critical Interrupt** (defender  loses Momentum, gains Stagger)

### Misses do **not** end chains.

They simply open *windows* for Interrupt attempts.

```
[DUNGEON WHISPER]
“One mistake is a warning. Two is dinner.”
```

---

## **6.8 ENDING THE CHAIN**

A chain ends when:

- You complete all declared actions
- You choose to stop early (rare)
- You are Interrupted by 5+ or take damage
- You are stunned
- Your RP hits 0 mid‑chain (declared chain invalidates — failure)

### When the chain ends:

- Heat resets (unless stabilized)
- Balance resets next turn
- Momentum resets next turn

```
[DUNGEON CLOSURE]
“Did you intend that? Or merely survive it?”
```
