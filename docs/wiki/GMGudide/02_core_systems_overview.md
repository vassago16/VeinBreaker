# 🩸 **SECTION 2 — CORE SYSTEMS OVERVIEW**

Veinbreaker’s combat is built on three interlocking flows:

## **1. BALANCE — Your Offensive Rhythm**

Balance measures how stable, centered, or overextended you are during a chain. It changes with each declared action.

### **Balance States**

- **Positive Balance (+1 to +3)**: Perfect form, precise footwork, tactical control.\
  *Gained from Perfect Defense or Balance Surge.*
- **Neutral (0)**: Centered stance; no bonuses or penalties.
- **Negative (–1 to –10)**: Overextension from attacks, abilities, and heavy actions.

### **Effects of Balance**

Balance modifies your **Attack Value (AV)**:

- Positive Balance **adds** to Attack Value.
- Negative Balance **subtracts** from Attack Value.

Every action after your first affects balance.
Typical action costs are light attack −1 Balance, heavy −2  
A movment action will help you regain 2 balance

Balance resets to **0 at the start of your turn** unless a debuff prevents it.

## **2. HEAT — Your Aggressive Flow**

Heat rises when attacks hit.\
Heat resets when your chain ends.

### **Heat Thresholds**

- **Heat 1:** No bonus
- **Heat 2:** +1 damage
- **Heat 3:** +2 damage
- **Heat 4:** +3 damage, increased Execution pressure
- **Heat 5:** +4 damage, high Interrupt risk

### **Heat Spend**

Heat can be spent **between actions in a chain**.

**Heat Burst:** Spend all Heat → add **Heat × 2** bonus damage.\
**Heat Purge:** Spend all Heat → Balance resets to **0** (chain continues).\
**Heat Stabilize:** At Heat 3+ → preserve up to **2 Heat** into next turn.

## **3. MOMENTUM — Your Defensive Rhythm**

Momentum rises when you successfully Dodge, Parry, or Block. It fuels **Perfect Defense**, allowing:

- Perfect Dodge
- Perfect Parry
- Perfect Block

**Perfect Defense → +1 Positive Balance**

Momentum resets at the start of your turn.

```
[DUNGEON APPROVAL]
“You move well when survival matters.”

## **4. RESOLVE — Your Action Currency**

Resolve (RP) is spent to declare actions in a chain. Every action costs **1 RP**, minimum.

You gain RP when you:

- Hit an enemy
- Perfect Defend
- Execute
- Impress the Dungeon (rare bonuses)

Resolve refreshes **2 RP at the start of your turn**, up to your Resolve cap (Tier 0 cap: **5**). Unspent RP carries over between turns; you cannot exceed your cap.

---

## **5. ATTACK VALUE (AV) & DEFENSE VALUE (DV)**

Veinbreaker uses the **A3 Contest System**:

### **ATTACK VALUE = d20 + Bonuses – Balance Penalty + Positive Balance**

### **DEFENSE VALUE = d20 + Momentum + IDF + situational modifiers**

Attack Value vs Defense Value determines hit or miss.

Margin ≥ 5 → **Perfect Defense or Perfect Block** triggers special effects.

---

## **6. CHAIN DECLARATION (Core Rule)**

Before rolling, you must declare your full chain:

- The number of actions
- The type of each action
- RP is spent **now**, not later

Chains reflect rhythm, risk, and foresight.

You cannot change an action mid-chain unless an item, boon, or ability explicitly allows it.

```
