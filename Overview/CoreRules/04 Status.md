# Status Conditions (Quick Guide)

Key conditions, what they do, and common interactions. Use these to track setup/finish windows (e.g., Primed for Execution).

| Condition   | Effect                                                            | Notes / Interactions                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Bleed       | Target takes recurring damage each round or per hit; stacks add.  | Stacks fuel Hemocratic finishers; Wound Mark adds +1 to next Bleed. |
| Stagger     | Target’s posture disrupted; penalties on next offensive/defense.  | Often sets up vulnerability; high stacks can Prime. |
| Vulnerable  | Defenses compromised; certain abilities hit harder.               | At 3 stacks, target becomes **Primed**.       |
| Primed      | Exposed for **Execution** or special finishers.                   | Also triggered at ≤25% HP or Stagger 2+ (table/GM). |
| Slowed      | Reduced movement/chase; cannot benefit from speed boosts.         | Reapply to keep foes pinned.                  |
| Distracted  | Penalty (typically –1) to next attack roll.                       | Short-lived; pairs with feints/redirects.     |
| Exhausted   | Starts turn with 0 RP; cannot declare actions until RP > 0.       | Remove with utility/support; shuts down chains. |
| Telegraph   | Defender gains +1 to defense rolls during an interrupt challenge. | Watch for big swings; use to Perfect Defend.  |
| Radiance    | Divine energy that empowers Faith abilities; often stacks 0–3.    | Consumed for big miracles; raises some damage. |

## Execution
- **Prereq:** Target is **Primed** (e.g., Vulnerable 3, Stagger 2+, ≤25% HP, or an effect that Primes).
- **Cost:** Replaces your next attack; costs 1 RP; applies a heavy Balance penalty (typically –2).
- **Roll:** AV vs DV (A3). On success, finish the target (or deal heavy damage if above 0 HP). On failure, your chain ends and you usually suffer Stagger/penalty.
- **Heat/Balance:** Heat resets after Execution; Balance resets at turn start as normal unless modified.
- **Blood Mark gain:** Successful Executions often grant 1 Blood Mark (see below).

## Blood Marks (Dungeon Attention Meter)
- Earned by Executions, stylish play, high-risk/high-Heat moments.
- Typical benefits (table-dependent): bonus damage vs Wounded, Momentum on Perfect Defense, extra Resolve action slot, Execution range widens, etc.
- Typical costs: more aggressive enemies, hunters/attention, harsher encounters.
- Blood Marks rarely decrease; cleansing is costly (shrines, sacrifices, contracts).
