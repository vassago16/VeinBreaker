# Character & Creation (Streamlined)

Build fast, play fast. Pick stats, derive pools/HP/Resolve, choose a path focus, grab starting abilities, and jump in.

## Core Stats
- Attributes start at 8; spend 18 Veinscore (cap 14 at creation). This is your main build budget.
- POW, AGI, MND, SPR set your damage scaling and define your pools for each path.
- HP = 10 + POW. More Power means more staying power.
- Pools (refresh each round): Martial = POW / 2; Shadow = AGI / 2; Magic = MND / 2; Faith = SPR / 2. These fuel abilities from their paths.
- Resolve (RP): refresh 3 RP at start of turn up to your cap (Tier 0: 5; Tier 1: 6; Tier 2: 7; Tier 3: 8). RP is the tempo currency for declaring actions.

## Paths & Pool Spend
- **Martial** → pays Martial pool (Power-driven weapons/techniques).
- **Shadow** → pays Shadow pool (Agility-driven bleed/evasion).
- **Magic** → pays Magic pool (Mind-driven conduit/arcanum).
- **Faith** → pays Faith pool (Spirit-driven canticle/radiance).
Each ability clearly lists its pool cost; pools refresh every round, so spend them with intent.

## Starting Kit (Tier 0)
- Choose 4 actions: 1 Attack, 1 Reaction (Dodge/Parry/Block/Slip/Ward), 1 Utility, 1 Movement.
- Each action costs 1 RP to declare and 0 pool at Tier 0, so you can focus on learning the rhythm.
- Pick weapon/focus tags to unlock compatible actions (e.g., Heavy/Blunt for Block/Guard Break; Finesse/Slashing for Parry/Riposte; Magic/Faith Conduit for Redirect/Ward). Tags are permission slips, not damage bumps.

## Costs, Cooldowns, Chains
- Every declared action in your chain costs 1 RP (paid upfront for the whole chain).
- Above Tier 0, abilities also cost their path pool and respect cooldowns; pools refresh each round, cooldowns do not.
- If an ability is off cooldown and you can pay both RP and the right pool, you can play it. No pay, no play.

## Quick Creation Steps
1) Assign attributes (18 Veinscore; cap 14). Compute HP, pools, Resolve cap.  
2) Pick a path focus (Martial/Shadow/Magic/Faith) and weapon/focus tags.  
3) Choose Tier 0 actions (attack, reaction, utility, movement).  
4) Note starting Balance/Momentum/Heat at 0.  
5) In play: declare chains, spend RP, and pay path pool for higher-tier abilities when unlocked.
