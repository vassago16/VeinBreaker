# A Round of Play — “Stone Learns Your Name”

## Situation
Riven (POW 12, AGI 10) faces a Stonebound Warden in a narrow chamber. The Warden carries a heavy shield and hammer — slow, punishing, hard to break.

Riven starts the round with:
- Resolve: 5 (max)
- Balance: 0
- Heat: 0
- Momentum: 0

The Warden is un-Primed, uninjured. The Dungeon watches.

## Start of Turn (Automatic)
- Resolve regenerates +2 RP, but Riven is at max → stays 5 RP.
- Balance resets to 0; Heat resets to 0; Momentum resets to 0.
- Dungeon: “Fresh breath. Fresh fear. Begin.”

## Chain Declaration (Core Rule)
Riven declares the entire chain before rolling:
- Light Attack (probe)
- Heavy Attack (commit)
- Movement (Dash) (recover footing)
- Heavy Attack (finish)

Cost: 4 actions → 4 RP spent immediately (Resolve drops 5 → 1).

Dungeon Notice: “Chain pattern locked. Let’s see if you meant it.”

## Action 1 — Light Attack
- Balance change: −1 (Light Attack)
- A3 contest: Riven AV d20 (15) + mods − Balance (0, opening action ignores Balance) vs Warden DV d20 (11) → Hit.
- Effects: Damage applied; Heat +1.
- State: Balance −1; Heat 1; Momentum 0.
- Interrupt check: none (first action).

## Action 2 — Heavy Attack
- Balance change: −2 (was −1 → −3).
- A3 contest: Riven AV d20 (14) −3 = 11 vs Warden DV d20 (12) → Miss.
- Miss does NOT end the chain; opens punishment window.

Interrupt attempt (enemy):
- Enemy AV d20 (16) vs Riven DV d20 (13) + Momentum 0 → Enemy wins by 3 (hit, no chain break; margin <5).
- Riven takes damage; chain continues.

## Action 3 — Movement (Dash)
- Movement recovers Balance: was −3 → choose +2 → Balance −1.
- No A3 roll. Warden already used its interrupt; no new interrupt.
- State: Balance −1; Heat 1; Momentum 0.

## Action 4 — Heavy Attack (Final)
- Balance change: −2 (−1 → −3).
- Spend last 1 RP on Resolve Action: Greed Burst (+2 to next AV); Resolve now 0.
- A3 contest: Riven AV d20 (17) −3 +2 = 16 vs Warden DV d20 (10) → Hit.
- Effects: Damage applied; Heat +1 (now 2); Heavy weapon applies Stagger 1.

## End of Chain
- Chain complete.
- Heat resets to 0 (no Stabilize); Balance will reset next turn; Momentum stays 0.
- Enemy injured and Staggered.
- Dungeon: “Messy. Inefficient. Effective.”

## Takeaways
- Chains are declared up front — intent matters.
- Misses don’t end play; they create danger.
- Movement is a rhythm tool, not just positioning.
- Resolve is clutch, not spammed.
- Enemies push back mid-chain.
- Balance tracks real risk; Heat tempts greed; Momentum rewards defense.

Riven didn’t play safe. They played Veinbreaker.

## Enemy POV — “The Stone Tests the Beat”

The intruder stands too straight. That is the first tell. The Dungeon teaches the Warden this: those who begin centered intend to overreach.

The Warden does not rush. It waits for rhythm.

### Opening Exchange
The intruder strikes first — a shallow cut, meant to measure.
- No commitment
- No instability
- Heat just beginning to rise

Dungeon Pulse: Not yet. Let them feel safe. The blow lands. Stone chips. Nothing breaks.

### The Overreach
The second motion comes too hard. The Warden feels it in the air — weight forward, hips late, balance spilling. The blade swings wide. Miss. That moment — that fraction — is everything. The Dungeon opens a window.

### Interrupt Opportunity
The Warden takes it. Hammer comes down, not to kill — to test. Impact lands. The intruder staggers but does not fall. The chain does not break.

Dungeon Murmur: They survive. Interesting.

The Warden notes this carefully:
- The rhythm bends
- But does not collapse
- This one recovers

### Footwork Adjustment
The intruder moves — not fleeing, not advancing. Correcting. Stone boots scrape. Balance returns.

The Warden feels the danger now. Dungeon Warning: They learned.

No more Interrupts this turn. The Warden must endure what comes next.

### Final Strike
The intruder gathers themselves. Heavy. Focused. Fueled by desperation. The Dungeon flares — Resolve spent. The blow lands deep. Cracks run through the Warden’s guard plates. The world lurches. Stagger.

Dungeon Satisfaction: Yes. That one felt good.

### End of the Exchange
The intruder stands breathing hard. They did not kill. They did not flee. But they proved something. The Warden adjusts its stance, shield lowering a fraction. It will change tactics next round. The Dungeon remembers this rhythm.

### What the Enemy “Knows” (Without Numbers)
- Misses invite punishment
- Movement is dangerous when done well
- Resolve spikes are visible
- Long chains are greedy
- Recovery separates prey from hunters

This creature will:
- Interrupt earlier next time
- Pressure after movement
- Punish repeated heavy patterns

Because the Dungeon does not want fairness. It wants escalation.
